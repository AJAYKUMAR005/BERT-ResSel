0desktop	0desktop can be used to create launchers for zero install applications in desktop environments supporting the freedesktop.org menu specification (e.g. gnome and kde). if the uri of a zero install application is given, this application is added. without a uri, a dialog box is displayed prompting the user to specify what to add. on success, a launcher is added to the user's menu which, when invoked, runs the application using the command "0launch uri".add. on success, a launcher is added
0install	zero install is a decentralised cross-distribution software installation system. programs and libraries are identified by uris, and there is no need for a central repository. zero install ensures that packages cannot conflict with each other and that programs can be shared between mutually untrusting users. see the web-site for more information: http://0install.net/ the simplest case is to ask 0install to run a program, given its uri. for example: 0install run http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/edit the first time you do this, details about available
0launch	0launch runs the given program. program is either a url in the form 'http://site/program.xml' or a local path name like '/path/to/program.xml'. if the program is not already on your computer, 0launch downloads information about which versions are available, and lets you choose one to download. it will also (automatically) do the same for any libraries the program needs. note that much of the functionality that was originally in 0launch has now moved to 0install(1). 0launch program args is roughly equivalent
0store	0store provides access to the low-level implementation cache. normally, the cache is updated automatically using 0launch(1).0store provides access to the low-level implementation cache. normally, the cache is updated automatically using 0launch(1). 
0store-secure-add	this command imports the current directory into the system-wide shared zero install cache, as /var/cache/0install.net/implementations/digest. this allows a program downloaded by one user to be shared with other users. the current directory must contain a file called '.manifest' listing all the files to be added (in the format required by digest), and this file must have the given digest. if not, the import is refused. therefore, it is only possible to add a directory to the cache if its name
3ddesk	3d desktop is an opengl program for switching virtual desktops in a seamless 3-dimensional manner. the default "visualization" maps your screen onto an n-sided "carousel" which is rotated to select the next screen. when activated the current desktop appears to zoom out so as to make your desktop appear to be actually in a 3d environment with your other desktops.appears to zoom out so as to make your desktop appear to be actually in a 3d environment with your other
3ddeskd	this is the server for 3ddesk. 3ddeskd runs at all times to reduce load time and maintain a persistent state. in order for 3ddesk to work the server needs to be running in the background before you can go 3d. just run "3ddeskd" to start it. give the --acquire option to acquire cached versions of all your desktops. it will cycle thru all your desktops/workspaces. 3ddesk activates the server and gives you a fullscreen. you only need to start 3ddeskd

aarch64-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
aarch64-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
aarch64-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
aarch64-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
aarch64-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
aarch64-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
aarch64-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
aarch64-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
aarch64-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
aarch64-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

aarch64-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
aarch64-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
aarch64-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
aarch64-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
aarch64-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
aarch64-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
aarch64-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

alpha-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
alpha-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
alpha-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
alpha-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
alpha-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in

alpha-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
alpha-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
alpha-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
alpha-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
alpha-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
alpha-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
alpha-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

arm-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
arm-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
arm-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
arm-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in

avr-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
avr-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
avr-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
avr-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
avr-g++	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are

bc	bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements. there are some similarities in the syntax to the c programming language. a standard math library is available by command line option. if requested, the math library is defined before processing any files. bc starts by processing code from all the files listed on the command line in the order listed. after all files have been processed, bc reads from the standard input. all code is
bcc	bcc is a simple c compiler that produces 8086 assembler, in addition compiler compile time options allow 80386 or 6809 versions. the compiler understands traditional k&r c with just the restriction that bit fields are mapped to one of the other integer types. the default operation is to produce an 8086 executable called a.out from the source file.the default operation is to produce an 8086 executable called a.out from the source file. 
bcfg2	
bchunk	bchunk converts a cd image in a ".bin / .cue" format (sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks. the bin/cue format is used by some non-unix cd-writing software, but is not supported on most other cd-writing programs. image.bin is the raw cd image file. image.cue is the track index file containing track types and offsets. basename is used for the beginning part of the created track files. the produced .iso track contains an iso file

bdftopcf	bdftopcf is a font compiler for the x server and font server. fonts in portable compiled format can be read by any architecture, although the file is structured to allow one particular architecture to read them directly without reformatting. this allows fast reading on the appropriate machine, but the files are still portable (but read more slowly) on other machines.allows fast reading on the appropriate machine, but the files are still portable (but read more slowly) on other machines. 
bdftruncate	bdftruncate allows one to generate from an iso10646-1 encoded bdf font other iso10646-1 bdf fonts in which all characters above a threshold code value are stored unencoded. this is often desirable because the xlib api and x11 protocol data structures used for representing font metric information are extremely inefficient when handling sparsely populated fonts.for representing font metric information are extremely inefficient when handling sparsely populated fonts. 
bdii-update	the bdii-update process obtains the ldif by reading files found the ldif directory, running providers found in the provider directory and running plugins found in the plugin directory. the difference between providers and plugins is that providers return complete entries and plugins provide modifications to existing entries. the process can be run either as a daemon that periodically syncronizes an ldap database or as a command that will print the result to stdout.be run either as a daemon that periodically
bdy	bdy is a filter used to find boundary curves in geomview objects. the program reads a geomview object from standard input and prints the resultant vector object to standard output. bdy finds the segments of the vector by first converting the given object into a polylist (see anytooff(1)). then, it finds all edges used once and only once in the polylist and combines these edges into a vector object. the optional precision arguement specifies the maximum distance between vertices that

bf_compact	bf_compact creates a more compact bogofilter working directory with a dump/load cycle and renames the previous bogofilter_directory to bogofilter_directory.old. note: bf_compact cannot be used to process the current working directory, ".", because that cannot be renamed. if no wordlist_file arguments are given, then bf_compact will use the configured set of wordlists, if the given bogofilter_directory is the same as the configured, or use all *.db files if it is a different directory.the same as the configured, or use all *.db
bf_copy	bf_copy copies a bogofilter working directory to another directory. currently it copies the database files (*.db), related files (log.*), and db_config (if present).db_config (if present). 
bf_tar	bf_tar bundles a bogofilter working directory in tar format and copies it to standard output (your console, or where you redirect it, see examples below).below). 
bfctl	most mpi users will probably not need to use the bfctl and sweep commands; see lamclean(1). this command is only installed if lam/mpi was configured with the --with-trillium switch. the bfctl command controls buffering parameters on any node. it must be called with an option: bfctl <node(s)> by itself has no function. sweep is used after an application program error or premature termination to remove all messages held in buffers. the total space that can be consumed by the buffer
bfin-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
bfin-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
bfin-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
bfin-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
bfin-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
bfin-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
bfin-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
bfin-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
bfin-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
bfin-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
bfin-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
bfin-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a
bfin-linux-gnu-nm	gnu nm lists the symbols from object files objfile.... if no object files are listed as arguments, nm assumes the file a.out. for each symbol, nm shows:for each symbol, nm shows: 
bfin-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
bfin-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
bfin-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
bfin-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
bfin-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
bfin-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
bfin-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

bfr	bfr's purpose is to buffer data. (i hope this is obvious. =)) it buffers from its standard input and/or a list of files of your choosing, and allows this data to flow to its standard output at whatever rate that end can handle. its useful for any situation in which its beneficial to have i/o occur in a detached yet smooth fashion... possible applications: • - cd burning. a user in spain was using this in front of cdrecord, apparently
bfstate	most mpi users will probably not need to use the bfstate command; see mpimsg(1). this command is only installed if lam/mpi was configured with the --with-trillium switch. the bfstate command displays information on lam network message buffers on any node in the multicomputer. for each message, bfstate outputs the following information: node node containing the message dest destination node of the message event message event (see nsend(2)) type message type length message length in bytes the -l option prints the
bglafile	bglafile is a module access file generator. it produces file that suits bigloo option -afile. a module access file is a scheme list. each elements of that list is a list of at least two elements: a module name, the file that implements that module. for bee (the bigloo integrated development environment) to be able to retrieve files from module names, it is mandatory that the first parentheses of the global list is left alone on one line.of the global
bgldepend	bgldepend program reads each sourcefile in sequence and parses it to find the module include and import module directives. bgldepend computes the transitive closure of the import relationship. that is, it is sufficient to provide bgldepend with a single bigloo file that imports all the project file (e.g. the "main" file.) every file that a sourcefile includes, directly or indirectly, is what bgldepend calls a dependency. these dependencies are then written to a makefile in such a way that make(1)

cg-admin-setuprepo	setup a public git repository, that is, one that has no attached working copy and you typically only push into it and pull from it. you need to run this command before you will be able to push into the repository for the first time, but you will be also unable to pull from the repository until you push into it at first. therefore the workflow is to first init a regular private repository, then use this command to create
cg-admin-uncommit	takes a commit id which is the earliest commit to be removed from the repository. if no parameter is passed, it uncommits the latest commit (head). read the caveats section before using it for the first time. this command is a close relative of cg-switch -f (which does essentially the same thing, but is slightly more powerful at the expense of a more elaborate usage). do not confuse either with the operation performed by gitlink:cg-seek[1], which is meant only for
cg-branch-add	takes the desired branch name and source location as parameters. this command lets you add to the list of remote branches. those are branches in your local repository which correspond to some branches in other repositories. after you add a remote branch, you can gitlink:cg-fetch[1] from it to get the latest changes on the branch, as they appeared in the remote repository. terminology note: this command concerns remote branches, not the local ones (those managed by gitlink:cg-switch[1]). the possible source

cg-commit	commits your changes to the git repository. accepts the commit message from stdin. if the commit message is not modified the commit will be aborted. by default, the commit is recorded as made by you, but you can change that - useful if you are e.g. applying a patch submitted by someone else. see the environment section below. note that you can undo a commit by the gitlink:cg-admin-uncommit[1] command, but that is possible only under special circumstances. see the caveats
cg-diff	outputs a diff for converting the first tree to the second one. by default compares the current working tree to the state at the last commit. the output will automatically be displayed in a pager unless it is piped to a program.will automatically be displayed in a pager unless it is piped to a program. 
cg-export	takes a destination and optionally a tree id as a parameter, defaulting to head. the destination can be either a .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 or .tgz for generating a tarball. other destination specifiers are assumed to be directory names, and the tree is exported to the given directory.and the tree is exported to the given directory. 
cg-fetch	takes the branch name as an argument, defaulting to origin. this will fetch the latest changes from a remote repository to the corresponding branch in your local repository. note that this operation does not involve merging those changes to your own branch - that is being done by the gitlink:cg-merge[1] command. gitlink:cg-update[1] exists to conveniently bundle the act of fetching and merging to your working branch together. before the first fetch, you have to tell cogito about the remote branch.
cg-help	takes an optional argument describing the command to show the help for. the command can be specified either as command or cg-command. if the argument is left out an overview of all the cogito commands will be shown. note, short help for a command is also available by passing --help or -h to the command. the complete command manual is shown when passing --long-help (and is the same as doing "cg-help command").is the same as doing "cg-help command"). 
cg-init	gitlink:cg-init[1] called in a non-empty directory will automatically add its contents in the initial commit. (please note that certain default ignore rules are applied during this operation. if any files were not added due to this, cg-init will advise you what to do.) this command is intended for creating repositories for work on new projects. if you want to clone an existing project, see gitlink:cg-clone[1]. if you want to set up a public repository not for direct work but only
cg-log	display log information for files or a range of commits. the output will automatically be displayed in a pager unless it is piped to a program.program. 
cg-merge	takes a parameter identifying the branch to be merged, defaulting to origin. this command merges all changes currently in the given branch to your current branch. this can produce a merging commit on your branch sticking the two branch together (so-called tree merge). however in case there are no changes in your branch that wouldn't be in the remote branch, no merge commit is done and commit pointer of your branch is just updated to the last commit on the
cg-mkpatch	generate a patch with diff statistics and meta info about each commit. note that if you want to use this as the output interface for your git tree containing changes against upstream git tree, please consider using the stgit tool ("quilt for git"), which will enable you to update your patches seamlessly, rebase them against the latest upstream version, directly send them over mail, etc.etc. 
cg-mv	takes either two filenames and removes a file from the first one to the second one, or a list of filenames and a dirname and moves all the files to the directory. the changes will be executed in your working tree immediately, but recorded to the repository only at the time of the next commit. note that so far, git/cogito does not track file renames/moves per se. therefore, doing gitlink:cg-mv[1] is currently the same as doing gitlink:cg-rm[1], gitlink:cg-add[1] from the
cg-object-id	if the id is not provided, head is used. the default behavior is to show the commit id.if the id is not provided, head is used. the default behavior is to show the commit id. 
cg-patch	this is basically just a smart patch wrapper. it handles stuff like mode changes, removal of files vs. zero-size files etc. for now the script can process the old-style cg-diff patches (those having the "(mode: 0123)" stuff on the + and --- lines) as well as the new-style git-diff patches (those with the "diff --git" lines).git-diff patches (those with the "diff --git" lines). 
cg-push	it will push your commits on the current branch (or as specified by the -r option) to the remote repository, provided that your commits follow the last commit in the remote repository. note that if the remote repository is associated with a working tree copy, this command won't update that. use cg-reset at the remote side to bring it in sync (but throw away any local changes in that tree). consider setting up a standalone repository (see gitlink:cg-admin-setuprepo[1]). takes the
cg-reset	reverts the working tree to a consistent state before any changes to it (including merges etc.) were done. this command will rebuild the state of the tree according to the commit of .git/refs/heads/master, so if your working tree got into basically any inconsistent state, this will cure it. basically, this is the opposite of gitlink:cg-commit[1] in some sense. this command is complementary to gitlink:cg-restore[1], which only brings individual files in sync with their state at the time of the last
cg-restore	restore given files to their original state. it recovers any files (or files passed as arguments to the command, respectively) removed locally whose removal was not recorded by gitlink:cg-rm[1]. if passed the -f parameter, it restores the files to their state as of the last commit (including bringing files removed with gitlink:cg-rm[1] back to life). if passed the -r parameter, it will not restore the file as of the last commit, but to the state in the given commit, tree,

consoletype	consoletype prints the type of console connected to standard input, and checks whether the console connected to standard input is the current foreground virtual console. with no arguments, it prints vt if console is a virtual terminal (/dev/tty* or /dev/console device if not on a serial console), serial if standard input is a serial console (/dev/console or /dev/ttys*) and pty if standard input is a pseudo terminal.if standard input is a pseudo terminal. 
conspy	conspy allows the user to take control of a linux virtual console. the user can see what is displayed on the console and their keystrokes are sent to it. to exit from conspy press the escape key three times in quick succession.to exit from conspy press the escape key three times in quick succession. 
cont-de	run the pdftex typesetter on file, usually creating file.pdf. if the file argument has no extension, ".tex" will be appended to it. instead of a filename, a set of pdftex commands can be given, the first of which must start with a backslash. with a &format argument pdftex uses a different set of precompiled commands, contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to use the -fmt format option instead. pdftex is a version of tex, with the e-tex extensions, that

createp	the program suggests passwords using a random number generator.the program suggests passwords using a random number generator. 
createuser	createuser creates a new postgresql user (or more precisely, a role). only superusers and users with createrole privilege can create new users, so createuser must be invoked by someone who can connect as a superuser or a user with createrole privilege. if you wish to create a new superuser, you must connect as a superuser, not merely with createrole privilege. being a superuser implies the ability to bypass all access permission checks within the database, so superuserdom should not be
cris-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
cris-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
cris-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
cris-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
cris-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
cris-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
cris-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
cris-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
cris-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
cris-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
cris-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
cris-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

cris-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
cris-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
cris-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
cris-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
cris-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
cris-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
cris-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names. 
cris-linux-gnu-windmc	windmc reads message definitions from an input file (.mc) and translate them into a set of output files. the output files may be of four kinds:kinds: 
cris-linux-gnu-windres	windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into an output file. either file may be in one of three formats:windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into an output file. either file may be in one of three formats: 
critical	the critical program displays a self-organizing critical system that gradually emerges from chaos. critical performs a simulation on a two-dimensional array of integers. the array is initialized to random values. on each iteration, it draws a line to the array position with the greatest value. it then replaces that location and the eight neighboring locations with randomly-selected values. the lines are initially random, but over time a chaotic self-organizing system evolves: areas of the screen which happen to have lower
crl	the crl command processes crl files in der or pem format.the crl command processes crl files in der or pem format. 
crl2pkcs7	the crl2pkcs7 command takes an optional crl and one or more certificates and converts them into a pkcs#7 degenerate "certificates only" structure.only" structure. 
cronolog	cronolog is a simple program that reads log messages from its input and writes them to a set of output files, the names of which are constructed using template and the current date and time. the template uses the same format specifiers as the unix date(1) command (which are the same as the standard c strftime library function). before writing a message cronolog checks the time to see whether the current log file is still valid and if not it
cronosplit	cronosplit is a simple program that reads lines from a set of input log files, which must be in common log format and write each lines to an output files, the name of which is constructed using the template specified and timestamp from the the line. the template uses the same format specifiers as the unix date(1) command (which are the same as the standard c strftime library function).library function). 
crontab	crontab is the program used to install, remove or list the tables used to drive the cron(8) daemon. each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/ , they are not intended to be edited directly. for selinux in mls mode can be even more crontabs - for each range. for more see selinux(8). the cron jobs could be allow or disallow for different users. for classical crontab there exists cron.allow and cron.deny files. if
cross-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
cross-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
cross-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
cross-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
cross-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
cross-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
cross-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
cross-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
cross-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
cross-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
cross-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
cross-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

cross-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
cross-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
cross-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program

frv-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
frv-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
frv-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input

func	"func" allows remote control of machines running funcd (called "minions") that are set to obey this machine (called the "overlord"). this includes performing various remote operations and gathering data. "func" can address multiple machines at the same time by specifying their names with globs, which follow shell glob syntax. groups of machines can also be specified in /etc/func/groups. to invoke func on a group of machines specifying "@groupname". see the project homepage (below) for a list of modules available and
func-build-map	func's delegation feature allows an overlord to execute commands through proxies (minions which also run as overlords) to reduce xmlrpc overhead and the amount of time required to execute commands over large func networks. to accomplish this task, func needs to know where each proxy and minion sits in the func network, and for the sake of expediency, this data is stored within a map file on the overlord. func-build-map, when run on an overlord, recursively probes through one's func
func-inventory	func-inventory runs against func-minions to gather information, and stores this information on the filesystem, in a tree arranged by hostname, module name, and method name. after each update, differences are commited to version control (using git), where they can be examined with tools such as "git log" and "gitk"."gitk". 
func-transmit	func includes a powerful python api for addressing the overlord via software. when writing an app in a language other than python, func-transmit can be used to operate the overlord and recieve structured results from it. this tool, func-transmit, is intended to be called using pipes, sending formatted data into stdin and recieving return codes via stdout. it also can be invoked using the shell.invoked using the shell.

( nb: stdin cannot not be used for any of these additional input file arguments.) the
funsky	funsky converts input sky coordinates ( ra , dec) to image coordinates (or vice versa) using the wcs information contained in the specified fits file. several calling sequences are supported in order to make it easy to specify coordinate positions in different ways. the first required argument is always the input fits file (or extension) containing the wcs information in an extension header. note that the data from this file is not used. by default, the program converts input ra
funtable	funtable selects rows from the specified fits extension (binary table only) of a fits file, or from a non-fits raw event file, and writes those rows to a fits binary table file. it also will create a fits binary table from an image or a raw array file. the first argument to the program specifies the fits file, raw event file, or raw array file. if "stdin" is specified, data are read from the standard input. use funtools bracket notation
funtbl	[ nb: this program has been deprecated in favor of the ascii text processing support in funtools. you can now perform fundisp on funtools ascii output files (specifying the table using bracket notation) to extract tables and columns.] the funtbl script extracts a specified table (without the header and comments) from a funtools ascii output file and writes the result to the standard output. the first non-switch argument is the ascii input file name (i.e. the saved output from funcnts,
funzip	funzip without a file argument acts as a filter; that is, it assumes that a zip archive (or a gzip'd(1) file) is being piped into standard input, and it extracts the first member from the archive to stdout. when stdin comes from a tty device, funzip assumes that this cannot be a stream of (binary) compressed data and shows a short help text, instead. if there is a file argument, then input is read from the specified file instead of
fuse-zip	fuse-zip is a fuse filesystem, that enables any program to work with a zip archive as though it is a plain directory. unlike kio or gnome vfs, it can be used in any application without modifications. unlike other fuse filesystems, only fuse-zip provides write support to zip archives. also, fuse-zip is faster that all known implementations on large archives with many files.archives with many files.

g3cat	g3cat concatenates g3 files. these can either be 'raw', that is, bitmaps packed according to the ccitt t.4 standard for one-dimensional bitmap encoding, or 'digifax' files, created by gnu's ghostscript package with the digifax drivers. its output is a concatenation of all the input files, in raw g3 format, with two white lines in between. if a - is given as input file, stdin is used. if the input data is malformed, a warning is printed to stderr, and the
g3topbm	this program is part of netpbm(1). g3topbm reads a group 3 fax file in mh format as input and produces a pbm image as output. g3topbm tolerates various deviations from the standard, so as to recover some of the image if there was a transmission error. one thing it tolerates is lines of varying length. the standard requires all the lines to be the same length; g3topbm makes the output image as wide as the longest line in the input
g77	the g77 command supports all the options supported by the gcc command. all gcc and g77 options are accepted both by g77 and by gcc (as well as any other drivers built at the same time, such as g++), since adding g77 to the gcc distribution enables acceptance of g77 options by all of the relevant drivers. in some cases, options have positive and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. this manual documents only one of
g_anadock	g_anadock analyses the results of an autodock run and clusters the structures together, based on distance or rmsd. the docked energy and free energy estimates are analysed, and for each cluster the energy statistics are printed. an alternative approach to this is to cluster the structures first using g_cluster and then sort the clusters on either lowest energy or average energy.energy. 
g_anaeig	g_anaeig analyzes eigenvectors. the eigenvectors can be of a covariance matrix ( g_covar) or of a normal modes analysis ( g_nmeig). when a trajectory is projected on eigenvectors, all structures are fitted to the structure in the eigenvector file, if present, otherwise to the structure in the structure file. when no run input file is supplied, periodicity will not be taken into account. most analyses are performed on eigenvectors -first to -last, but when -first is set to -1 you
g_analyze	g_analyze reads an ascii file and analyzes data sets. a line in the input file may start with a time (see option -time) and any number of y-values may follow. multiple sets can also be read when they are separated by & (option -n); in this case only one y-value is read from each line. all lines starting with and @ are skipped. all analyses can also be done for the derivative of a set (option -d). all options, except
g_angle	g_angle computes the angle distribution for a number of angles or dihedrals. this way you can check whether your simulation is correct. with option -ov you can plot the average angle of a group of angles as a function of time. with the -all option the first graph is the average, the rest are the individual angles. with the -of option, g_angle also calculates the fraction of trans dihedrals (only for dihedrals) as function of time, but this is probably
g_bar	g_bar calculates free energy difference estimates through bennett's acceptance ratio method (bar). it also automatically adds series of individual free energies obtained with bar into a combined free energy estimate. every individual bar free energy difference relies on two simulations at different states: say state a and state b, as controlled by a parameter, lambda (see the .mdp parameter init_lambda). the bar method calculates a ratio of weighted average of the hamiltonian difference of state b given state a and
g_bond	g_bond makes a distribution of bond lengths. if all is well a gaussian distribution should be made when using a harmonic potential. bonds are read from a single group in the index file in order i1-j1 i2-j2 through in-jn. -tol gives the half-width of the distribution as a fraction of the bondlength ( -blen). that means, for a bond of 0.2 a tol of 0.1 gives a distribution from 0.18 to 0.22. option -d plots all the distances as a
g_bundle	g_bundle analyzes bundles of axes. the axes can be for instance helix axes. the program reads two index groups and divides both of them in -na parts. the centers of mass of these parts define the tops and bottoms of the axes. several quantities are written to file: the axis length, the distance and the z-shift of the axis mid-points with respect to the average center of all axes, the total tilt, the radial tilt and the lateral tilt with
g_chi	g_chi computes phi, psi, omega, and chi dihedrals for all your amino acid backbone and sidechains. it can compute dihedral angle as a function of time, and as histogram distributions. the distributions (histo-(dihedral)(residue).xvg) are cumulative over all residues of each type. if option -corr is given, the program will calculate dihedral autocorrelation functions. the function used is c(t) = cos(chi(tau)) cos(chi(tau+t)) . the use of cosines rather than angles themselves, resolves the problem of periodicity. (van der spoel & berendsen
g_cluster	g_cluster can cluster structures using several different methods. distances between structures can be determined from a trajectory or read from an .xpm matrix file with the -dm option. rms deviation after fitting or rms deviation of atom-pair distances can be used to define the distance between structures. single linkage: add a structure to a cluster when its distance to any element of the cluster is less than cutoff. jarvis patrick: add a structure to a cluster when this structure and
g_clustsize	this program computes the size distributions of molecular/atomic clusters in the gas phase. the output is given in the form of an .xpm file. the total number of clusters is written to an .xvg file. when the -mol option is given clusters will be made out of molecules rather than atoms, which allows clustering of large molecules. in this case an index file would still contain atom numbers or your calculation will die with a segv. when velocities are present
g_confrms	g_confrms computes the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of two structures after least-squares fitting the second structure on the first one. the two structures do not need to have the same number of atoms, only the two index groups used for the fit need to be identical. with -name only matching atom names from the selected groups will be used for the fit and rmsd calculation. this can be useful when comparing mutants of a protein. the superimposed structures are
g_covar	g_covar calculates and diagonalizes the (mass-weighted) covariance matrix. all structures are fitted to the structure in the structure file. when this is not a run input file periodicity will not be taken into account. when the fit and analysis groups are identical and the analysis is non mass-weighted, the fit will also be non mass-weighted. the eigenvectors are written to a trajectory file ( -v). when the same atoms are used for the fit and the covariance analysis, the reference
g_current	g_current is a tool for calculating the current autocorrelation function, the correlation of the rotational and translational dipole moment of the system, and the resulting static dielectric constant. to obtain a reasonable result, the index group has to be neutral. furthermore, the routine is capable of extracting the static conductivity from the current autocorrelation function, if velocities are given. additionally, an einstein-helfand fit can be used to obtain the static conductivity. the flag -caf is for the output of the
g_density	compute partial densities across the box, using an index file. for the total density of npt simulations, use g_energy instead. densities are in kg/m3, and number densities or electron densities can also be calculated. for electron densities, a file describing the number of electrons for each type of atom should be provided using -ei. it should look like: 2 atomname = nrelectrons atomname = nrelectrons the first line contains the number of lines to read from the file. there should
g_densmap	g_densmap computes 2d number-density maps. it can make planar and axial-radial density maps. the output .xpm file can be visualized with for instance xv and can be converted to postscript with xpm2ps. optionally, output can be in text form to a .dat file with -od, instead of the usual .xpm file with -o. the default analysis is a 2-d number-density map for a selected group of atoms in the x-y plane. the averaging direction can be changed with the option
g_densorder	a small program to reduce a two-phase density distribution along an axis, computed over a md trajectory to 2d surfaces fluctuating in time, by a fit to a functional profile for interfacial densities a time-averaged spatial representation of the interfaces can be output with the option -tavgoutput with the option -tavg 
g_dielectric	g_dielectric calculates frequency dependent dielectric constants from the autocorrelation function of the total dipole moment in your simulation. this acf can be generated by g_dipoles. for an estimate of the error you can run g_statistics on the acf, and use the output thus generated for this program. the functional forms of the available functions are: one parameter: y = exp[-a1 x], two parameters: y = a2 exp[-a1 x], three parameters: y = a2 exp[-a1 x] + (1 - a2) exp[-a3
g_dih	g_dih can do two things. the default is to analyze dihedral transitions by merely computing all the dihedral angles defined in your topology for the whole trajectory. when a dihedral flips over to another minimum an angle/time plot is made. the opther option is to discretize the dihedral space into a number of bins, and group each conformation in dihedral space in the appropriate bin. the output is then given as a number of dihedral conformations sorted according to occupancy.output

g_disre	g_disre computes violations of distance restraints. if necessary, all protons can be added to a protein molecule using the g_protonate program. the program always computes the instantaneous violations rather than time-averaged, because this analysis is done from a trajectory file afterwards it does not make sense to use time averaging. however, the time averaged values per restraint are given in the log file. an index file may be used to select specific restraints for printing. when the optional -q flag
g_dist	g_dist can calculate the distance between the centers of mass of two groups of atoms as a function of time. the total distance and its x-, y-, and z-components are plotted. or when -dist is set, print all the atoms in group 2 that are closer than a certain distance to the center of mass of group 1. with options -lt and -dist the number of contacts of all atoms in group 2 that are closer than a certain distance
g_do_dssp	do_dssp reads a trajectory file and computes the secondary structure for each time frame calling the dssp program. if you do not have the dssp program, get it from http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp. do_dssp assumes that the dssp executable is located in /usr/local/bin/dssp. if this is not the case, then you should set an environment variable dssp pointing to the dssp executable, e.g.: setenv dssp /opt/dssp/bin/dssp the structure assignment for each residue and time is written to an .xpm matrix file. this file

g_eneconv	with multiple files specified for the -f option: concatenates several energy files in sorted order. in the case of double time frames, the one in the later file is used. by specifying -settime you will be asked for the start time of each file. the input files are taken from the command line, such that the command eneconv -f *.edr -o fixed.edr should do the trick. with one file specified for -f: reads one energy file and writes another, applying
g_enemat	g_enemat extracts an energy matrix from the energy file ( -f). with -groups a file must be supplied with on each line a group of atoms to be used. for these groups matrix of interaction energies will be extracted from the energy file by looking for energy groups with names corresponding to pairs of groups of atoms, e.g. if your -groups file contains: 2 protein sol then energy groups with names like 'coul-sr:protein-sol' and 'lj:protein-sol' are expected in the energy
g_energy	g_energy extracts energy components or distance restraint data from an energy file. the user is prompted to interactively select the desired energy terms. average, rmsd, and drift are calculated with full precision from the simulation (see printed manual). drift is calculated by performing a least-squares fit of the data to a straight line. the reported total drift is the difference of the fit at the first and last point. an error estimate of the average is given based on a
g_filter	g_filter performs frequency filtering on a trajectory. the filter shape is cos(pi t/a) + 1 from -a to +a, where a is given by the option -nf times the time step in the input trajectory. this filter reduces fluctuations with period a by 85%, with period 2*a by 50% and with period 3*a by 17% for low-pass filtering. both a low-pass and high-pass filtered trajectory can be written. option -ol writes a low-pass filtered trajectory. a frame is written every
g_genbox	genbox can do one of 3 things: 1) generate a box of solvent. specify -cs and -box. or specify -cs and -cp with a structure file with a box, but without atoms. 2) solvate a solute configuration, e.g. a protein, in a bath of solvent molecules. specify -cp (solute) and -cs (solvent). the box specified in the solute coordinate file ( -cp) is used, unless -box is set. if you want the solute to be centered in the box, the
g_genconf	genconf multiplies a given coordinate file by simply stacking them on top of each other, like a small child playing with wooden blocks. the program makes a grid of user-defined proportions ( -nbox), and interspaces the grid point with an extra space -dist. when option -rot is used the program does not check for overlap between molecules on grid points. it is recommended to make the box in the input file at least as big as the coordinates + van

g_hbond	g_hbond computes and analyzes hydrogen bonds. hydrogen bonds are determined based on cutoffs for the angle acceptor - donor - hydrogen (zero is extended) and the distance hydrogen - acceptor. oh and nh groups are regarded as donors, o is an acceptor always, n is an acceptor by default, but this can be switched using -nitacc. dummy hydrogen atoms are assumed to be connected to the first preceding non-hydrogen atom. you need to specify two groups for analysis, which must
g_helix	g_helix computes all kinds of helix properties. first, the peptide is checked to find the longest helical part, as determined by hydrogen bonds and phi/psi angles. that bit is fitted to an ideal helix around the z-axis and centered around the origin. then the following properties are computed: 1. helix radius (file radius.xvg). this is merely the rms deviation in two dimensions for all calpha atoms. it is calced as sqrt((sum i(x2(i)+y2(i)))/n), where n is the number of backbone atoms.

g_pdb2gmx	this program reads a .pdb (or .gro) file, reads some database files, adds hydrogens to the molecules and generates coordinates in gromacs (gromos), or optionally .pdb, format and a topology in gromacs format. these files can subsequently be processed to generate a run input file. pdb2gmx will search for force fields by looking for a forcefield.itp file in subdirectories forcefield.ff of the current working directory and of the gromacs library directory as inferred from the path of the binary or
g_pme_error	g_pme_error estimates the error of the electrostatic forces if using the spme algorithm. the flag -tune will determine the splitting parameter such that the error is equally distributed over the real and reciprocal space part. the part of the error that stems from self interaction of the particles is computationally demanding. however, a good a approximation is to just use a fraction of the particles for this term which can be indicated by the flag -self.this term which can be

gindxbib	indxbib makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases in filename... for use with refer(1), lookbib(1), and lkbib(1). the index will be named filename.i; the index is written to a temporary file which is then renamed to this. if no filenames are given on the command line because the -f option has been used, and no -o option is given, the index will be named ind.i. bibliographic databases are divided into records by blank lines. within a record, each fields
ginfo	list service urls and other attributes.list service urls and other attributes. 
ginsh	ginsh is an interactive frontend for the ginac symbolic computation framework. it is intended as a tool for testing and experimenting with ginac's features, not as a replacement for traditional interactive computer algebra systems. although it can do many things these traditional systems can do, ginsh provides no programming constructs like loops or conditional expressions. if you need this functionality you are advised to write your program in c++, using the "native" ginac class framework.functionality you are advised to write
git	git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. see gittutorial(7) to get started, then see everyday git [1] for a useful minimum set of commands, and "man git-commandname" for documentation of each command. cvs users may also want to read gitcvs-migration(7). see the git user's manual [2] for a more in-depth introduction. the command is either a name of a git command (see
git-add	this command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. it typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore. the "index" holds a snapshot of the content
git-am	splits mail messages in a mailbox into commit log message, authorship information and patches, and applies them to the current branch.splits mail messages in a mailbox into commit log message, authorship information and patches, and applies them to the current branch. 
git-annex	git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file contents into git. while that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due to limitations in memory, checksumming time, or disk space. even without file content tracking, being able to manage files with git, move files around and delete files with versioned directory trees, and use branches and distributed clones, are all very handy reasons to use git. and
git-annex-shell	git-annex-shell is a restricted shell, similar to git-shell, which can be used as a login shell for ssh accounts. since its syntax is identical to git-shell's, it can be used as a drop-in replacement anywhere git-shell is used. for example it can be used as a user's restricted login shell.restricted login shell. 
git-annotate	annotates each line in the given file with information from the commit which introduced the line. optionally annotates from a given revision. the only difference between this command and git-blame(1) is that they use slightly different output formats, and this command exists only for backward compatibility to support existing scripts, and provide a more familiar command name for people coming from other scm systems.backward compatibility to support existing scripts, and provide a more familiar command name for people coming from
git-apply	reads the supplied diff output (i.e. "a patch") and applies it to files. with the --index option the patch is also applied to the index, and with the --cache option the patch is only applied to the index. without these options, the command applies the patch only to files, and does not require them to be in a git repository.git repository. 
git-archimport	imports a project from one or more arch repositories. it will follow branches and repositories within the namespaces defined by the <archive/branch> parameters supplied. if it cannot find the remote branch a merge comes from it will just import it as a regular commit. if it can find it, it will mark it as a merge whenever possible (see discussion below). the script expects you to provide the key roots where it can start the import from an initial import
git-archive	creates an archive of the specified format containing the tree structure for the named tree, and writes it out to the standard output. if <prefix> is specified it is prepended to the filenames in the archive. git archive behaves differently when given a tree id versus when given a commit id or tag id. in the first case the current time is used as the modification time of each file in the archive. in the latter case the commit time
git-bisect	the command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:the command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand: 
git-blame	annotates each line in the given file with information from the revision which last modified the line. optionally, start annotating from the given revision. the command can also limit the range of lines annotated. the report does not tell you anything about lines which have been deleted or replaced; you need to use a tool such as git diff or the "pickaxe" interface briefly mentioned in the following paragraph. apart from supporting file annotation, git also supports searching the development
git-branch	with no arguments, existing branches are listed and the current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk. option -r causes the remote-tracking branches to be listed, and option -a shows both. with --contains, shows only the branches that contain the named commit (in other words, the branches whose tip commits are descendants of the named commit). with --merged, only branches merged into the named commit (i.e. the branches whose tip commits are reachable from the named commit) will be listed.
git-bundle	some workflows require that one or more branches of development on one machine be replicated on another machine, but the two machines cannot be directly connected, and therefore the interactive git protocols (git, ssh, rsync, http) cannot be used. this command provides support for git fetch and git pull to operate by packaging objects and references in an archive at the originating machine, then importing those into another repository using git fetch and git pull after moving the archive by
git-cat-file	in its first form, the command provides the content or the type of an object in the repository. the type is required unless -t or -p is used to find the object type, or -s is used to find the object size. in the second form, a list of objects (separated by linefeeds) is provided on stdin, and the sha1, type, and size of each object is printed on stdout.stdout. 
git-check-attr	for every pathname, this command will list if each attribute is unspecified, set, or unset as a gitattribute on that pathname.pathname. 
git-check-ref-format	checks if a given refname is acceptable, and exits with a non-zero status if it is not. a reference is used in git to specify branches and tags. a branch head is stored under the $git_dir/refs/heads directory, and a tag is stored under the $git_dir/refs/tags directory (or, if refs are packed by git gc, as entries in the $git_dir/packed-refs file). git imposes the following rules on how references are named:are named: 
git-checkout	when <paths> are not given, this command switches branches by updating the index, working tree, and head to reflect the specified branch. if -b is given, a new branch is created and checked out, as if git-branch(1) were called; in this case you can use the --track or --no-track options, which will be passed to git branch. as a convenience, --track without -b implies branch creation; see the description of --track below. when <paths> or --patch are given, this command
git-checkout-index	will copy all files listed from the index to the working directory (not overwriting existing files).will copy all files listed from the index to the working directory (not overwriting existing files). 
git-cherry	the changeset (or "diff") of each commit between the fork-point and <head> is compared against each commit between the fork-point and <upstream>. the commits are compared with their patch id, obtained from the git patch-id program. every commit that doesn't exist in the <upstream> branch has its id (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol. the ones that have equivalent change already in the <upstream> branch are prefixed with a minus (-) sign, and those that only exist in the <head>
git-cherry-pick	given one existing commit, apply the change the patch introduces, and record a new commit that records it. this requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the head commit).modifications from the head commit). 
git-citool	a tcl/tk based graphical interface to review modified files, stage them into the index, enter a commit message and record the new commit onto the current branch. this interface is an alternative to the less interactive git commit program. git citool is actually a standard alias for git gui citool. see git-gui(1) for more details.git citool is actually a standard alias for git gui citool. see git-gui(1) for more details. 
git-clean	cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory. normally, only files unknown to git are removed, but if the -x option is specified, ignored files are also removed. this can, for example, be useful to remove all build products. if any optional <path>... arguments are given, only those paths are affected.if any optional <path>... arguments are given, only those paths are affected. 
git-clone	clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository (visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository's currently active branch. after the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update all the remote-tracking branches, and a git pull without arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the current master branch, if any. this default configuration
git-commit	stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes. the content to be added can be specified in several ways:the content to be added can be specified in several ways: 
git-commit-tree	this is usually not what an end user wants to run directly. see git-commit(1) instead. creates a new commit object based on the provided tree object and emits the new commit object id on stdout. a commit object may have any number of parents. with exactly one parent, it is an ordinary commit. having more than one parent makes the commit a merge between several lines of history. initial (root) commits have no parents. while a tree represents a particular
git-config	you can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. the name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped. multiple lines can be added to an option by using the --add option. if you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a posix regexp value_regex needs to be given. only the existing values that match the regexp are updated or unset. if you want to handle the
git-count-objects	this counts the number of unpacked object files and disk space consumed by them, to help you decide when it is a good time to repack.this counts the number of unpacked object files and disk space consumed by them, to help you decide when it is a good time to repack. 
git-cvsexportcommit	exports a commit from git to a cvs checkout, making it easier to merge patches from a git repository into a cvs repository. specify the name of a cvs checkout using the -w switch or execute it from the root of the cvs working copy. in the latter case git_dir must be defined. see examples below. it does its best to do the safe thing, it will check that the files are unchanged and up to date in the cvs
git-cvsimport	imports a cvs repository into git. it will either create a new repository, or incrementally import into an existing one. splitting the cvs log into patch sets is done by cvsps. at least version 2.1 is required. warning: for certain situations the import leads to incorrect results. please see the section issues for further reference. you should never do any work of your own on the branches that are created by git cvsimport. by default initial import will create and
git-cvsserver	this application is a cvs emulation layer for git. it is highly functional. however, not all methods are implemented, and for those methods that are implemented, not all switches are implemented. testing has been done using both the cli cvs client, and the eclipse cvs plugin. most functionality works fine with both of these clients.testing has been done using both the cli cvs client, and the eclipse cvs plugin. most functionality works fine with both of these clients. 
git-daemon	a really simple tcp git daemon that normally listens on port "default_git_port" aka 9418. it waits for a connection asking for a service, and will serve that service if it is enabled. it verifies that the directory has the magic file "git-daemon-export-ok", and it will refuse to export any git directory that hasn't explicitly been marked for export this way (unless the --export-all parameter is specified). if you pass some directory paths as git daemon arguments, you can further restrict
git-describe	the command finds the most recent tag that is reachable from a commit. if the tag points to the commit, then only the tag is shown. otherwise, it suffixes the tag name with the number of additional commits on top of the tagged object and the abbreviated object name of the most recent commit. by default (without --all or --tags) git describe only shows annotated tags. for more information about creating annotated tags see the -a and -s options to
git-diff	show changes between two trees, a tree and the working tree, a tree and the index file, or the index file and the working tree. git diff [--options] [--] [<path>...]git diff [--options] [--] [<path>...] 
git-diff-files	compares the files in the working tree and the index. when paths are specified, compares only those named paths. otherwise all entries in the index are compared. the output format is the same as for git diff-index and git diff-tree.compared. the output format is the same as for git diff-index and git diff-tree. 
git-diff-index	compares the content and mode of the blobs found via a tree object with the content of the current index and, optionally ignoring the stat state of the file on disk. when paths are specified, compares only those named paths. otherwise all entries in the index are compared.on disk. when paths are specified, compares only those named paths. otherwise all entries in the index are compared. 
git-diff-tree	compares the content and mode of the blobs found via two tree objects. if there is only one <tree-ish> given, the commit is compared with its parents (see --stdin below). note that git diff-tree can use the tree encapsulated in a commit object.note that git diff-tree can use the tree encapsulated in a commit object. 
git-difftool	git difftool is a git command that allows you to compare and edit files between revisions using common diff tools. git difftool is a frontend to git diff and accepts the same options and arguments.to git diff and accepts the same options and arguments. 
git-fast-export	this program dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to be piped into git fast-import. you can use it as a human-readable bundle replacement (see git-bundle(1)), or as a kind of an interactive git filter-branch.you can use it as a human-readable bundle replacement (see git-bundle(1)), or as a kind of an interactive git filter-branch. 
git-fast-import	this program is usually not what the end user wants to run directly. most end users want to use one of the existing frontend programs, which parses a specific type of foreign source and feeds the contents stored there to git fast-import. fast-import reads a mixed command/data stream from standard input and writes one or more packfiles directly into the current repository. when eof is received on standard input, fast import writes out updated branch and tag refs, fully updating
git-fetch	fetches named heads or tags from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete them. the ref names and their object names of fetched refs are stored in .git/fetch_head. this information is left for a later merge operation done by git merge. when <refspec> stores the fetched result in tracking branches, the tags that point at these branches are automatically followed. this is done by first fetching from the remote using the given <refspec>s, and if
git-fetch-pack	usually you would want to use git fetch, which is a higher level wrapper of this command, instead. invokes git-upload-pack on a possibly remote repository and asks it to send objects missing from this repository, to update the named heads. the list of commits available locally is found out by scanning the local refs/ hierarchy and sent to git-upload-pack running on the other end. this command degenerates to download everything to complete the asked refs from the remote side when
git-filter-branch	lets you rewrite git revision history by rewriting the branches mentioned in the <rev-list options>, applying custom filters on each revision. those filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite on all files) or information about each commit. otherwise, all information (including original commit times or merge information) will be preserved. the command will only rewrite the positive refs mentioned in the command line (e.g. if you pass a..b, only b will be rewritten).
git-fmt-merge-msg	takes the list of merged objects on stdin and produces a suitable commit message to be used for the merge commit, usually to be passed as the <merge-message> argument of git merge. this command is intended mostly for internal use by scripts automatically invoking git merge.this command is intended mostly for internal use by scripts automatically invoking git merge. 
git-for-each-ref	iterate over all refs that match <pattern> and show them according to the given <format>, after sorting them according to the given set of <key>. if <count> is given, stop after showing that many refs. the interpolated values in <format> can optionally be quoted as string literals in the specified host language allowing their direct evaluation in that language.literals in the specified host language allowing their direct evaluation in that language. 
git-format-patch	prepare each commit with its patch in one file per commit, formatted to resemble unix mailbox format. the output of this command is convenient for e-mail submission or for use with git am. there are two ways to specify which commits to operate on.there are two ways to specify which commits to operate on. 
git-fsck	verifies the connectivity and validity of the objects in the database.verifies the connectivity and validity of the objects in the database. 
git-fsck-objects	this is a synonym for git-fsck(1). please refer to the documentation of that command.this is a synonym for git-fsck(1). please refer to the documentation of that command. 
git-gc	runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository, such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase performance) and removing unreachable objects which may have been created from prior invocations of git add. users are encouraged to run this task on a regular basis within each repository to maintain good disk space utilization and good operating performance. some git commands may automatically run git gc; see the --auto flag below for details. if you know what
git-get-tar-commit-id	acts as a filter, extracting the commit id stored in archives created by git archive. it reads only the first 1024 bytes of input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the size of <tarfile> very much. if no commit id is found, git get-tar-commit-id quietly exists with a return code of 1. this can happen if <tarfile> had not been created using git archive or if the first parameter of git archive had been a tree id instead of
git-grep	look for specified patterns in the tracked files in the work tree, blobs registered in the index file, or blobs in given tree objects.look for specified patterns in the tracked files in the work tree, blobs registered in the index file, or blobs in given tree objects. 
git-gui	a tcl/tk based graphical user interface to git. git gui focuses on allowing users to make changes to their repository by making new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches, performing local merges, and fetching/pushing to remote repositories. unlike gitk, git gui focuses on commit generation and single file annotation and does not show project history. it does however supply menu actions to start a gitk session from within git gui. git gui is known to work on all popular unix
git-hash-object	computes the object id value for an object with specified type with the contents of the named file (which can be outside of the work tree), and optionally writes the resulting object into the object database. reports its object id to its standard output. this is used by git cvsimport to update the index without modifying files in the work tree. when <type> is not specified, it defaults to "blob".without modifying files in the work tree. when <type> is not
git-help	with no options and no command given, the synopsis of the git command and a list of the most commonly used git commands are printed on the standard output. if the option --all or -a is given, then all available commands are printed on the standard output. if a git command is named, a manual page for that command is brought up. the man program is used by default for this purpose, but this can be overridden by other options
git-http-backend	a simple cgi program to serve the contents of a git repository to git clients accessing the repository over http:// and https:// protocols. the program supports clients fetching using both the smart http protocol and the backwards-compatible dumb http protocol, as well as clients pushing using the smart http protocol. it verifies that the directory has the magic file "git-daemon-export-ok", and it will refuse to export any git directory that hasn't explicitly been marked for export this way (unless the
git-http-fetch	downloads a remote git repository via http.downloads a remote git repository via http. 
git-http-push	sends missing objects to remote repository, and updates the remote branch. note: this command is temporarily disabled if your libcurl is older than 7.16, as the combination has been reported not to work and sometimes corrupts repository.corrupts repository. 
git-imap-send	this command uploads a mailbox generated with git format-patch into an imap drafts folder. this allows patches to be sent as other email is when using mail clients that cannot read mailbox files directly. the command also works with any general mailbox in which emails have the fields "from", "date", and "subject" in that order. typical usage is something like: git format-patch --signoff --stdout --attach origin | git imap-sendgit format-patch --signoff --stdout --attach origin | git imap-send 
git-index-pack	reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and builds a pack index file (.idx) for it. the packed archive together with the pack index can then be placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a git repository.be placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a git repository. 
git-init	this command creates an empty git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files. an initial head file that references the head of the master branch is also created. if the $git_dir environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of ./.git for the base of the repository. if the object storage directory is specified via the $git_object_directory environment variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath - otherwise
git-init-db	this is a synonym for git-init(1). please refer to the documentation of that command.this is a synonym for git-init(1). please refer to the documentation of that command. 
git-instaweb	a simple script to set up gitweb and a web server for browsing the local repository.a simple script to set up gitweb and a web server for browsing the local repository. 
git-log	shows the commit logs. the command takes options applicable to the git rev-list command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the git diff-* commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown.commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown. 
git-lost-found	note: this command is deprecated. use git-fsck(1) with the option --lost-found instead. finds dangling commits and tags from the object database, and creates refs to them in the .git/lost-found/ directory. commits and tags that dereference to commits are stored in .git/lost-found/commit, and other objects are stored in .git/lost-found/other.commits are stored in .git/lost-found/commit, and other objects are stored in .git/lost-found/other. 
git-ls-files	this merges the file listing in the directory cache index with the actual working directory list, and shows different combinations of the two. one or more of the options below may be used to determine the files shown:one or more of the options below may be used to determine the files shown: 
git-ls-remote	displays references available in a remote repository along with the associated commit ids.displays references available in a remote repository along with the associated commit ids. 
git-ls-tree	lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a" does in the current working directory. note that:lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a" does in the current working directory. note that: 
git-mailinfo	reads a single e-mail message from the standard input, and writes the commit log message in <msg> file, and the patches in <patch> file. the author name, e-mail and e-mail subject are written out to the standard output to be used by git am to create a commit. it is usually not necessary to use this command directly. see git-am(1) instead.use this command directly. see git-am(1) instead. 
git-mailsplit	splits a mbox file or a maildir into a list of files: "0001" "0002" .. in the specified directory so you can process them further from there.splits a mbox file or a maildir into a list of files: "0001" "0002" .. in the specified directory so you can process them further from there. 
git-merge	incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. this command is used by git pull to incorporate changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another. assume the following history exists and the current branch is "master": a---b---c topic / d---e---f---g master then "git merge topic" will replay the changes made on the topic branch since it diverged from
git-merge-base	git merge-base finds best common ancestor(s) between two commits to use in a three-way merge. one common ancestor is better than another common ancestor if the latter is an ancestor of the former. a common ancestor that does not have any better common ancestor is a best common ancestor, i.e. a merge base. note that there can be more than one merge base for a pair of commits. among the two commits to compute the merge base from, one is
git-merge-file	git merge-file incorporates all changes that lead from the <base-file> to <other-file> into <current-file>. the result ordinarily goes into <current-file>. git merge-file is useful for combining separate changes to an original. suppose <base-file> is the original, and both <current-file> and <other-file> are modifications of <base-file>, then git merge-file combines both changes. a conflict occurs if both <current-file> and <other-file> have changes in a common segment of lines. if a conflict is found, git merge-file normally outputs a warning and brackets
git-merge-index	this looks up the <file>(s) in the index and, if there are any merge entries, passes the sha1 hash for those files as arguments 1, 2, 3 (empty argument if no file), and <file> as argument 4. file modes for the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7.argument if no file), and <file> as argument 4. file modes for the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7. 
git-merge-one-file	this is the standard helper program to use with git merge-index to resolve a merge after the trivial merge done with git read-tree -m.-m. 
git-merge-tree	reads three treeish, and output trivial merge results and conflicting stages to the standard output. this is similar to what three-way git read-tree -m does, but instead of storing the results in the index, the command outputs the entries to the standard output. this is meant to be used by higher level scripts to compute merge results outside of the index, and stuff the results back into the index. for this reason, the output from the command omits entries that
git-mergetool	use git mergetool to run one of several merge utilities to resolve merge conflicts. it is typically run after git merge. if one or more <file> parameters are given, the merge tool program will be run to resolve differences on each file. if no <file> names are specified, git mergetool will run the merge tool program on every file with merge conflicts.specified, git mergetool will run the merge tool program on every file with merge conflicts. 
git-mergetool--lib	this is not a command the end user would want to run. ever. this documentation is meant for people who are studying the porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones. the git-mergetool-lib scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by other shell scripts to set up functions for working with git merge tools. before sourcing git-mergetool-lib, your script must set tool_mode to define the operation mode for the functions listed below. diff and merge are valid values.merge are valid
git-mktag	reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object that can also be used to sign other objects. the output is the new tag's <object> identifier.the output is the new tag's <object> identifier. 
git-mktree	reads standard input in non-recursive ls-tree output format, and creates a tree object. the order of the tree entries is normalised by mktree so pre-sorting the input is not required. the object name of the tree object built is written to the standard output.the input is not required. the object name of the tree object built is written to the standard output. 
git-mv	this script is used to move or rename a file, directory or symlink.this script is used to move or rename a file, directory or symlink. 
git-name-rev	finds symbolic names suitable for human digestion for revisions given in any format parsable by git rev-parse.finds symbolic names suitable for human digestion for revisions given in any format parsable by git rev-parse. 
git-notes	this command allows you to add/remove notes to/from objects, without changing the objects themselves. a typical use of notes is to extend a commit message without having to change the commit itself. such commit notes can be shown by git log along with the original commit message. to discern these notes from the message stored in the commit object, the notes are indented like the message, after an unindented line saying "notes (<refname>):" (or "notes:" for the default setting). this
git-pack-objects	reads list of objects from the standard input, and writes a packed archive with specified base-name, or to the standard output. a packed archive is an efficient way to transfer a set of objects between two repositories as well as an access efficient archival format. in a packed archive, an object is either stored as a compressed whole or as a difference from some other object. the latter is often called a delta. the packed archive format (.pack) is designed
git-pack-redundant	this program computes which packs in your repository are redundant. the output is suitable for piping to xargs rm if you are in the root of the repository. git pack-redundant accepts a list of objects on standard input. any objects given will be ignored when checking which packs are required. this makes the following command useful when wanting to remove packs which contain unreachable objects. git fsck --full --unreachable | cut -d ' ' -f3 | \ git pack-redundant --all
git-pack-refs	traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as refs) were stored one file per ref under $git_dir/refs directory. while many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags and some branch tips are never updated. when a repository has hundreds or thousands of tags, this one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage and hurts performance. this command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by stashing the refs in a single file, $git_dir/packed-refs. when a ref is missing
git-parse-remote	this script is included in various scripts to supply routines to parse files under $git_dir/remotes/ and $git_dir/branches/ and configuration variables that are related to fetching, pulling and pushing.are related to fetching, pulling and pushing. 
git-patch-id	a "patch id" is nothing but a sha1 of the diff associated with a patch, with whitespace and line numbers ignored. as such, it's "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., two patches that have the same "patch id" are almost guaranteed to be the same thing. iow, you can use this thing to look for likely duplicate commits. when dealing with git diff-tree output, it takes advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed

git-prune	note in most cases, users should run git gc, which calls git prune. see the section "notes", below.in most cases, users should run git gc, which calls git prune. see the section "notes", below. 
git-prune-packed	this program searches the $git_object_dir for all objects that currently exist in a pack file as well as the independent object directories. all such extra objects are removed. a pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file. packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.
git-pull	runs git fetch with the given parameters, and calls git merge to merge the retrieved head(s) into the current branch. with --rebase, calls git rebase instead of git merge. note that you can use . (current directory) as the <repository> to pull from the local repository - this is useful when merging local branches into the current branch. also note that options meant for git pull itself and underlying git merge must be given before the options meant for git
git-push	updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs. you can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you push into it, by setting up hooks there. see documentation for git-receive-pack(1).git-receive-pack(1). 
git-quiltimport	applies a quilt patchset onto the current git branch, preserving the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present in the quilt patchset. for each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the patch description. if that fails it falls back to the author specified with --author. if the --author flag was not given the patch description is displayed and the user is asked to interactively enter the author of the patch. if a subject is not found
git-read-tree	reads the tree information given by <tree-ish> into the index, but does not actually update any of the files it "caches". (see: git-checkout-index(1)) optionally, it can merge a tree into the index, perform a fast-forward (i.e. 2-way) merge, or a 3-way merge, with the -m flag. when used with -m, the -u flag causes it to also update the files in the work tree with the result of the merge. trivial merges are done by git read-tree itself. only conflicting
git-rebase	if <branch> is specified, git rebase will perform an automatic git checkout <branch> before doing anything else. otherwise it remains on the current branch. all changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in <upstream> are saved to a temporary area. this is the same set of commits that would be shown by git log <upstream>..head (or git log head, if --root is specified). the current branch is reset to <upstream>, or <newbase> if the --onto
git-receive-pack	invoked by git send-pack and updates the repository with the information fed from the remote end. this command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. the ui for the protocol is on the git send-pack side, and the program pair is meant to be used to push updates to remote repository. for pull operations, see git-fetch-pack(1). the command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs (heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the local end
git-reflog	the command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand:the command takes various subcommands, and different options depending on the subcommand: 
git-relink	this will scan 1 or more object repositories and look for objects in common with a master repository. objects not already hardlinked to the master repository will be replaced with a hardlink to the master repository.repository will be replaced with a hardlink to the master repository. 
git-remote	manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track. 
git-remote-ext	this remote helper uses the specified <command> to connect to a remote git server. data written to stdin of the specified <command> is assumed to be sent to a git:// server, git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or git-upload-archive (depending on situation), and data read from stdout of <command> is assumed to be received from the same service. command and arguments are separated by an unescaped space. the following sequences have a special meaning:the following sequences have a special meaning: 
git-remote-fd	this helper uses specified file descriptors to connect to a remote git server. this is not meant for end users but for programs and scripts calling git fetch, push or archive. if only <infd> is given, it is assumed to be a bidirectional socket connected to remote git server (git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or git-upload-achive). if both <infd> and <outfd> are given, they are assumed to be pipes connected to a remote git server (<infd> being the inbound pipe and <outfd> being
git-remote-helpers	remote helper programs are normally not used directly by end users, but they are invoked by git when it needs to interact with remote repositories git does not support natively. a given helper will implement a subset of the capabilities documented here. when git needs to interact with a repository using a remote helper, it spawns the helper as an independent process, sends commands to the helper's standard input, and expects results from the helper's standard output. because a remote
git-repack	this script is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in a "pack", into a pack. it can also be used to re-organize existing packs into a single, more efficient pack. a pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file. packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.packs are used to reduce the load on mirror
git-replace	adds a replace reference in .git/refs/replace/ the name of the replace reference is the sha1 of the object that is replaced. the content of the replace reference is the sha1 of the replacement object. unless -f is given, the replace reference must not yet exist in .git/refs/replace/ directory. replacement references will be used by default by all git commands except those doing reachability traversal (prune, pack transfer and fsck). it is possible to disable use of replacement references for any
git-repo-config	this is a synonym for git-config(1). please refer to the documentation of that command.this is a synonym for git-config(1). please refer to the documentation of that command. 
git-request-pull	summarizes the changes between two commits to the standard output, and includes the given url in the generated summary.summarizes the changes between two commits to the standard output, and includes the given url in the generated summary. 
git-rerere	in a workflow employing relatively long lived topic branches, the developer sometimes needs to resolve the same conflicts over and over again until the topic branches are done (either merged to the "release" branch, or sent out and accepted upstream). this command assists the developer in this process by recording conflicted automerge results and corresponding hand resolve results on the initial manual merge, and applying previously recorded hand resolutions to their corresponding automerge results.merge, and applying previously recorded hand resolutions
git-reset	sets the current head to the specified commit and optionally resets the index and working tree to match. this command is useful if you notice some small error in a recent commit (or set of commits) and want to redo that part without showing the undo in the history. if you want to undo a commit other than the latest on a branch, git-revert(1) is your friend. the second and third forms with paths and/or --patch are used to revert
git-rev-list	list commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a ^ in front of them. the output is given in reverse chronological order by default. you can think of this as a set operation. commits given on the command line form a set of commits that are reachable from any of them, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with ^
git-rev-parse	many git porcelainish commands take mixture of flags (i.e. parameters that begin with a dash -) and parameters meant for the underlying git rev-list command they use internally and flags and parameters for the other commands they use downstream of git rev-list. this command is used to distinguish between them.distinguish between them. 
git-revert	given one existing commit, revert the change the patch introduces, and record a new commit that records it. this requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the head commit). note: git revert is used to record a new commit to reverse the effect of an earlier commit (often a faulty one). if you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working directory, you should see git-reset(1), particularly the --hard option. if you want to extract
git-review	git-review automates and streamlines some of the tasks involved with submitting local changes to a gerrit server for review. it is designed to make it easier to apprehend gerrit, especially for users that have recently switched to git from another version control system. the following options are available: -d change, --download=change download change from gerrit into a local branch. the branch will be named after the patch author and the name of a topic. if the local branch already exists,
git-rm	remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory. (there is no option to remove a file only from the working tree and yet keep it in the index; use /bin/rm if you want to do that.) the files being removed have to be identical to the tip of the branch, and no updates to their contents can be staged in the index, though
git-send-bugzilla	attach each commit between <since> and <until> to the bug <bugid> on gnome's bugzilla. if ..<until> is not specified, the head of the current working tree is implied. if -n (or bugzilla.numbered in the repository configuration) is specified, instead of "[patch] subject", the first line is formatted as "[n/m] subject".subject". 
git-send-email	takes the patches given on the command line and emails them out. patches can be specified as files, directories (which will send all files in the directory), or directly as a revision list. in the last case, any format accepted by git-format-patch(1) can be passed to git send-email. the header of the email is configurable by command line options. if not specified on the command line, the user will be prompted with a readline enabled interface to provide the necessary
git-send-pack	usually you would want to use git push, which is a higher-level wrapper of this command, instead. see git-push(1). invokes git-receive-pack on a possibly remote repository, and updates it from the current repository, sending named refs.invokes git-receive-pack on a possibly remote repository, and updates it from the current repository, sending named refs. 
git-sh-i18n	this is not a command the end user would want to run. ever. this documentation is meant for people who are studying the porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones. the 'git sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by git's porcelain programs implemented in shell script. it provides wrappers for the gnu gettext and eval_gettext functions accessible through the gettext.sh script, and provides pass-through fallbacks on systems without gnu gettext.gettext. 
git-sh-i18n--envsubst	this is not a command the end user would want to run. ever. this documentation is meant for people who are studying the plumbing scripts and/or are writing new ones. git sh-i18n--envsubst is git's stripped-down copy of the gnu envsubst(1) program that comes with the gnu gettext package. it's used internally by git-sh-i18n(1) to interpolate the variables passed to the the eval_gettext function. no promises are made about the interface, or that this program won't disappear without warning in the
git-sh-setup	this is not a command the end user would want to run. ever. this documentation is meant for people who are studying the porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones. the git sh-setup scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by other shell scripts to set up some variables pointing at the normal git directories and a few helper shell functions. before sourcing it, your script should set up a few variables; usage (and long_usage, if any) is used
git-shell	this is meant to be used as a login shell for ssh accounts you want to restrict to git pull/push access only. it permits execution only of server-side git commands implementing the pull/push functionality. the commands can be executed only by the -c option; the shell is not interactive. currently, only four commands are permitted to be called, git-receive-pack git-upload-pack and git-upload-archive with a single required argument, or cvs server (to invoke git-cvsserver).argument, or cvs server (to invoke git-cvsserver). 
git-shortlog	summarizes git log output in a format suitable for inclusion in release announcements. each commit will be grouped by author and the first line of the commit message will be shown. additionally, "[patch]" will be stripped from the commit description.additionally, "[patch]" will be stripped from the commit description. 
git-show	shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits). for commits it shows the log message and textual diff. it also presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by git diff-tree --cc. for tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects. for trees, it shows the names (equivalent to git ls-tree with --name-only). for plain blobs, it shows the plain contents. the command takes options applicable to the git diff-tree command to control how
git-show-branch	shows the commit ancestry graph starting from the commits named with <rev>s or <globs>s (or all refs under refs/heads and/or refs/tags) semi-visually. it cannot show more than 29 branches and commits at a time. it uses showbranch.default multi-valued configuration items if no <rev> nor <glob> is given on the command line.it uses showbranch.default multi-valued configuration items if no <rev> nor <glob> is given on the command line. 
git-show-index	reads given idx file for packed git archive created with git pack-objects command, and dumps its contents. the information it outputs is subset of what you can get from git verify-pack -v; this command only shows the packfile offset and sha1 of each object.object. 
git-show-ref	displays references available in a local repository along with the associated commit ids. results can be filtered using a pattern and tags can be dereferenced into object ids. additionally, it can be used to test whether a particular ref exists. the --exclude-existing form is a filter that does the inverse, it shows the refs from stdin that don't exist in the local repository. use of this utility is encouraged in favor of directly accessing files under the .git directory.use of
git-stage	this is a synonym for git-add(1). please refer to the documentation of that command.this is a synonym for git-add(1). please refer to the documentation of that command. 
git-stash	use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. the command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the head commit. the modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git stash list, inspected with git stash show, and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with git stash apply. calling git stash
git-status	displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current head commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by git (and are not ignored by gitignore(5)). the first are what you would commit by running git commit; the second and third are what you could commit by running git add before running git commit.running git commit; the second and third are what
git-stripspace	remove multiple empty lines, and empty lines at beginning and end.remove multiple empty lines, and empty lines at beginning and end. 
git-submodule	submodules allow foreign repositories to be embedded within a dedicated subdirectory of the source tree, always pointed at a particular commit. they are not to be confused with remotes, which are meant mainly for branches of the same project; submodules are meant for different projects you would like to make part of your source tree, while the history of the two projects still stays completely independent and you cannot modify the contents of the submodule from within the main project.
git-svn	git svn is a simple conduit for changesets between subversion and git. it provides a bidirectional flow of changes between a subversion and a git repository. git svn can track a standard subversion repository, following the common "trunk/branches/tags" layout, with the --stdlayout option. it can also follow branches and tags in any layout with the -t/-t/-b options (see options to init below, and also the clone command). once tracking a subversion repository (with any of the above methods), the git
git-symbolic-ref	given one argument, reads which branch head the given symbolic ref refers to and outputs its path, relative to the .git/ directory. typically you would give head as the <name> argument to see which branch your working tree is on. given two arguments, creates or updates a symbolic ref <name> to point at the given branch <ref>. a symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string that begins with ref: refs/. for example, your .git/head is a regular
git-tag	adds a tag reference in .git/refs/tags/. unless -f is given, the tag must not yet exist in .git/refs/tags/ directory. if one of -a, -s, or -u <key-id> is passed, the command creates a tag object, and requires the tag message. unless -m <msg> or -f <file> is given, an editor is started for the user to type in the tag message. if -m <msg> or -f <file> is given and -a, -s, and -u <key-id> are absent, -a is implied.
git-tar-tree	this command is deprecated. use git archive with --format=tar option instead (and move the <base> argument to --prefix=base/). creates a tar archive containing the tree structure for the named tree. when <base> is specified it is added as a leading path to the files in the generated tar archive. git tar-tree behaves differently when given a tree id versus when given a commit id or tag id. in the first case the current time is used as modification time of
git-unpack-file	creates a file holding the contents of the blob specified by sha1. it returns the name of the temporary file in the following format: .merge_file_xxxxx.merge_file_xxxxx 
git-unpack-objects	read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding the objects contained within and writing them into the repository in "loose" (one object per file) format. objects that already exist in the repository will not be unpacked from the pack-file. therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use this command on a pack-file that exists within the target repository. see git-repack(1) for options to generate new packs and replace existing ones.see git-repack(1) for options to generate new packs and
git-update-index	modifies the index or directory cache. each file mentioned is updated into the index and any unmerged or needs updating state is cleared. see also git-add(1) for a more user-friendly way to do some of the most common operations on the index. the way git update-index handles files it is told about can be modified using the various options:the way git update-index handles files it is told about can be modified using the various options: 
git-update-ref	given two arguments, stores the <newvalue> in the <ref>, possibly dereferencing the symbolic refs. e.g. git update-ref head <newvalue> updates the current branch head to the new object. given three arguments, stores the <newvalue> in the <ref>, possibly dereferencing the symbolic refs, after verifying that the current value of the <ref> matches <oldvalue>. e.g. git update-ref refs/heads/master <newvalue> <oldvalue> updates the master branch head to <newvalue> only if its current value is <oldvalue>. you can specify 40 "0" or an

grd2xyz	grd2xyz reads one or more binary 2-d grid files and writes out xyz-triplets in ascii [or binary] format to standard output. modify the precision of the ascii output format by editing the d_format parameter in your .gmtdefaults4 file or use --d_format=value on the command line, or choose binary output using single or double precision storage. as an option you may output z-values without the (x,y) in a number of formats, see -e or -z below.without the (x,y) in a number
grdblend	grdblend reads a listing of grid files and blend parameters and creates a binary grid file by blending the other grids using cosine-taper weights. grdblend will report if some of the nodes are not filled in with data. such unconstrained nodes are set to a value specified by the user [default is nan]. nodes with more than one value will be set to the weighted average value. note: due to the row-by-row i/o nature of operations in grdblend we only
grdclip	grdclip will set values < low to below and/or values > high to above. useful when you want all of a continent or an ocean to fall into one color or grayshade in image processing, or clipping of the range of data values is required. above/below can be any number or nan (not a number). you must choose at least one of -sa or -sb.values is required. above/below can be any number or nan (not a number). you must choose
grdcontour	grdcontour reads a 2-d grid file and produces a contour map by tracing each contour through the grid. as an option, the x/y/z positions of the contour lines may be dumped to a single multisegment file or many separate files. postscript code is generated and sent to standard output. various options that affect the plotting are available.code is generated and sent to standard output. various options that affect the plotting are available. 
grdcut	grdcut will produce a new output_file.grd file which is a subregion of input_file.grd. the subregion is specified with -r as in other programs; the specified range must not exceed the range of input_file.grd. if in doubt, run grdinfo to check range. alternatively, define the subregion indirectly via a range check on the node values. complementary to grdcut there is grdpaste, which will join together two grid files along a common edge.grdcut there is grdpaste, which will join together two grid
grdedit	grdedit reads the header information in a binary 2-d grid file and replaces the information with values provided on the command line [if any]. as an option, global, geographical grids (with 360 degrees longitude range) can be rotated in the east-west direction, and individual nodal values can be replaced from a table of x, y, z values. grdedit only operates on files containing a grdheader.grdheader. 
grdfft	grdfft will take the 2-d forward fast fourier transform and perform one or more mathematical operations in the frequency domain before transforming back to the space domain. an option is provided to scale the data before writing the new values to an output file. the horizontal dimensions of the grid are assumed to be in meters. geographical grids may be used by specifying the -m option that scales degrees to meters. if you have grids with dimensions in km, you
grdfilter	grdfilter will filter a .grd file in the time domain using one of the selected convolution or non-convolution isotropic filters and compute distances using cartesian or spherical geometries. the output .grd file can optionally be generated as a subopt(r)egion of the input and/or with a new -increment. in this way, one may have "extra space" in the input data so that the edges will not be used and the output can be within one-half- width of the input edges. if
grdgradient	grdgradient may be used to compute the directional derivative in a given direction (-a), or the direction (-s) [and the magnitude (-d)] of the vector gradient of the data. estimated values in the first/last row/column of output depend on boundary conditions (see -l).estimated values in the first/last row/column of output depend on boundary conditions (see -l). 
grdhisteq	grdhisteq allows the user to find the data values which divide a given grid file into patches of equal area. one common use of grdhisteq is in a kind of histogram equalization of an image. in this application, the user might have a grid of flat topography with a mountain in the middle. ordinary gray shading of this file (using grdimage/grdview) with a linear mapping from topography to graytone will result in most of the image being very dark gray,
grdimage	grdimage reads one 2-d grid file and produces a gray-shaded (or colored) map by plotting rectangles centered on each grid node and assigning them a gray-shade (or color) based on the z-value. alternatively, grdimage reads three 2-d grid files with the red, green, and blue components directly (all must be in the 0-255 range). optionally, illumination may be added by providing a file with intensities in the (-1,+1) range. values outside this range will be clipped. such intensity files can
grdinfo	grdinfo reads a 2-d binary grid file and reports various statistics for the (x,y,z) data in the grid file(s). the output information contains the minimum/maximum values for x, y, and z, where the min/max of z occur, the x- and y-increments, and the number of x and y nodes, and [optionally] the mean, standard deviation, and/or the median, l1 scale of z, and number of nodes set to nan.z, and number of nodes set to nan. 
grdlandmask	grdlandmask reads the selected shoreline database and uses that information to decide which nodes in the specified grid are over land or over water. the nodes defined by the selected region and lattice spacing will be set according to one of two criteria: (1) land vs water, or (2) the more detailed (hierarchical) ocean vs land vs lake vs island vs pond. the resulting mask may be used in subsequent operations involving grdmath to mask out data from land [or
grdmask	grdmask can operate in two different modes. 1. it reads one or more xy-files that each define a closed polygon. the nodes defined by the specified region and lattice spacing will be set equal to one of three possible values depending on whether the node is outside, on the polygon perimeter, or inside the polygon. the resulting mask may be used in subsequent operations involving grdmath to mask out data from polygonal areas. 2. the xy-files simply represent data point
grdmath	grdmath will perform operations like add, subtract, multiply, and divide on one or more grid files or constants using reverse polish notation (rpn) syntax (e.g., hewlett-packard calculator-style). arbitrarily complicated expressions may therefore be evaluated; the final result is written to an output grid file. when two grids are on the stack, each element in file a is modified by the corresponding element in file b. however, some operators only require one operand (see below). if no grid files are used
grdpaste	grdpaste will combine file_a.grd and file_b.grd into outfile.grd by pasting them together along their common edge. files file_a.grd and file_b.grd must have the same dx, dy and have one edge in common. if in doubt, check with grdinfo and use grdcut and/or grdsample if necessary to prepare the edge joint. for geographical grids, use -f to handle periodic longitudes.periodic longitudes. 
grdproject	grdproject will do one of two things depending whether -i has been set. if set, it will transform a gridded data set from a rectangular coordinate system onto a geographical system by resampling the surface at the new nodes. if not set, it will project a geographical gridded data set onto a rectangular grid. to obtain the value at each new node, its location is inversely projected back onto the input grid after which a value is interpolated between the
grdraster	grdraster reads a file called grdraster.info from the current working directory, the directories pointed to by the environment variables $gmt_datadir and $gmt_userdir, or in $gmt_sharedir/dbase (in that order). the file grdraster.info defines binary arrays of data stored in scan-line format in data files. each file is given a filenumber in the info file. grdraster figures out how to load the raster data into a grid file spanning a region defined by -r. by default the grid spacing equals the raster
grdreformat	grdreformat reads a grid file in one format and writes it out using another format. as an option the user may select a subset of the data to be written and to specify scaling, translation, and nan-value.an option the user may select a subset of the data to be written and to specify scaling, translation, and nan-value. 
grdrotater	grdrotater reads a geographical grid and reconstructs it given a total reconstruction rotation. optionally, the user may supply a clipping polygon in multiple-segment format; then, only the part of the grid inside the polygon is used to determine the return grid region. the outline of the projected region is returned on stdout provided the rotated region is not the entire globe. no space between the option flag and the associated arguments. use upper case for the option flags and lower
grdsample	grdsample reads a grid file and interpolates it to create a new grid file with either: a different registration (-f or -t); or, a new grid-spacing or number of nodes (-i), and perhaps also a new sub-region (-r). a bicubic [default], bilinear, b-spline or nearest-neighbor interpolation (-q) is used, requiring boundary conditions (-l). note that using -r only is equivalent to grdcut or grdedit -s. grdsample safely creates a fine mesh from a coarse one; the converse may suffer aliasing
grdspotter	grdspotter reads a grid file with residual bathymetry or gravity and calculates flowlines from each node that exceeds a minimum value using the specified rotations file. these flowlines are then convolved with the volume of the prism represented by each grid node and added up to give a cumulative volcano amplitude grid (cva). no space between the option flag and the associated arguments. use upper case for the option flags and lower case for modifiers.option flags and lower case for
grdtrack	grdtrack reads a grid file (or a sandwell/smith img file) and a table (from file or standard input) with (x,y) positions in the first two columns (more columns may be present). it interpolates the grid at the positions in the table and writes out the table with the interpolated values added as a new column. a bicubic [default], bilinear, b-spline or nearest-neighbor (see -q) interpolation is used, requiring boundary conditions at the limits of the region (see -l).used, requiring boundary
grdtrend	grdtrend reads a 2-d grid file and fits a low-order polynomial trend to these data by [optionally weighted] least-squares. the trend surface is defined by: m1 + m2*x + m3*y + m4*x*y + m5*x*x + m6*y*y + m7*x*x*x + m8*x*x*y + m9*x*y*y + m10*y*y*y. the user must specify -nn_model, the number of model parameters to use; thus, -n4 fits a bilinear trend, -n6 a quadratic surface, and so on. optionally, append r to the -n option to perform a robust
grdvector	grdvector reads two 2-d grid files which represents the x- and y-components of a vector field and produces a vector field plot by drawing vectors with orientation and length according to the information in the files. alternatively, polar coordinate components may be used (r, theta). grdvector is basically a short-hand for using 2 calls to grd2xyz and pasting the output through psxy -sv.psxy -sv. 
grdview	grdview reads a 2-d grid file and produces a 3-d perspective plot by drawing a mesh, painting a colored/grayshaded surface made up of polygons, or by scanline conversion of these polygons to a rasterimage. options include draping a data set on top of a surface, plotting of contours on top of the surface, and apply artificial illumination based on intensities provided in a separate grid file.top of a surface, plotting of contours on top of the surface, and apply artificial
grdvolume	grdvolume reads a 2-d binary grid file and calculates the volume contained between the surface and the plane specified by the given contour (or zero if not given) and reports the area, volume, and maximum mean height (volume/area). alternatively, specify a range of contours to be tried and grdvolume will determine the volume and area inside the contour for all contour values. the contour that produced the maximum mean height is reported as well. this feature may be used with
greenspline	greenspline uses the green's function g(x; x') for the chosen spline and geometry to interpolate data at regular [or arbitrary] output locations. mathematically, the solution is composed as w(x) = sum {c(i) g(x; x(i))}, for i = 1, n, the number of data points {x(i), w(i)}. once the n coefficients c(i) have been found then the sum can be evaluated at any output point x. choose between ten minimum curvature, regularized, or continuous curvature splines in tension for either 1-d,
grefer	this file documents the gnu version of refer, which is part of the groff document formatting system. refer copies the contents of filename... to the standard output, except that lines between .[ and .] are interpreted as citations, and lines between .r1 and .r2 are interpreted as commands about how citations are to be processed. each citation specifies a reference. the citation can specify a reference that is contained in a bibliographic database by giving a set of keywords that

grep	grep searches the named input files (or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing a match to the given pattern. by default, grep prints the matching lines. in addition, two variant programs egrep and fgrep are available. egrep is the same as grep -e. fgrep is the same as grep -f. direct invocation as either egrep or fgrep is deprecated, but is provided to allow historical
grep-changelog	grep-changelog searches the named changelogs (by default files matching the regular expressions changelog and changelog\.[0-9]+) for entries matching the specified criteria. at least one option or file must be specified. this program is distributed with gnu emacs.this program is distributed with gnu emacs. 
grepdiff	for each file modified by a patch, if the patch hunk contains the regex then the file's name is printed. the regular expression is treated as posix basic regular expression syntax, unless the -e option is given in which case posix extended regular expression syntax is used. for example, to see the patches in my.patch which contain the regular expression "pf_gfp_mask", use: grepdiff pf_gfp_mask my.patch | \ xargs -rn1 filterdiff my.patch -i you can use both unified and context format
grephistory	grephistory queries the inn history database for information about the specified message id . if no flags are given, the program prints the storage api token of the corresponding article, or "/dev/null" if the article is listed in the history database but not stored on the server. if the message id cannot be found in the database, grephistory will print "grephistory: not found" and exit with a non-zero status. be sure to escape any special characters in the message id
grepjar	the "grepjar" program can be used to search files in a jar file for a pattern.the "grepjar" program can be used to search files in a jar file for a pattern. 
grepmail	grepmail looks for mail messages containing a pattern, and prints the resulting messages on standard out. by default grepmail looks in both header and body for the specified pattern. when redirected to a file, the result is another mailbox, which can, in turn, be handled by standard user agents, such as elm, or even used as input for another instance of grepmail. at least one of -e, -e, -d, -s, or -u must be specified. the pattern is optional if
greynetic	the greynetic program draws random rectangles.the greynetic program draws random rectangles. 
grid-ca-create	the grid-ca-create program creates a self-signed ca certificate and related files needed to use the ca with other globus tools. the grid-ca-create program prompts for information to use to generate the ca certificate, but the prompts may be avoided by using the command line options. by default, the grid-ca-create program creates the self-signed ca certificate, installs it on the current machine in its trusted certificate directory, and creates a source tarball which can be used to generate an rpm package
grid-ca-package	the grid-ca-package utility creates a tarball containing an rpm spec file and the files needed to use a ca with grid tools. it optionally will also create a gpt package for distributing a ca. by default, the grid-ca-package utility displays a list of installed grid ca and prompts for which ca to package. it then creates a tarball containing the ca certificate, signing policy, ca configuration files, and an spec script to generate a binary rpm package containing the ca.
grid-ca-sign	the grid-ca-sign program signs a certificate based on a request file with a ca certificate created by grid-ca-create. the new certificate is written to a file. if the ca has already signed a certificate with the same subject name as contained in the certificate request, it will refuse to sign the new request unless the -force option is provided on the command-line. if run as a privileged user, grid-ca-sign uses the ca certificate and configuration located in ${localstatedir}/lib/globus/simple_ca to sign
grid-cert-diagnostics	the grid-cert-diagnostics program displays information about the current user's security environment, including information about security-related environment variables, security directory search path, personal key and certificates, and trusted certificates. it is intended to provide information to help diagnose problems using gsic. by default, grid-cert-diagnostics prints out information regarding the environment and trusted certificate directory. if the -p command-line option is used, then additional information about the current user's default certificate and key will be printed. the full set of command-line options
grid-cert-info	the grid-cert-info program displays information contained within a certificate file. by default it shows a text representation of the entire certificate. specific facts about the certificate can be shown instead by using command-line options. if any of those options are used, then the default display is suppressed. this can be added to the output by using the -all command-line option. if multiple display options are included on the command-line, the facts related to those will be displayed on separate lines
grid-cert-request	the grid-cert-request program generates an x.509 certificate request and corresponding private key for the specified name, host, or service. it is intended to be used with a ca implemented using the globus_simple_ca package. the default behavior of grid-cert-request is to generate a certificate request and private key for the user running the command. the subject name is derived from the gecos information in the local system's password database, unless the -commonname, -cn, or -host command-line options are used. by default,
grid-change-pass-phrase	the grid-change-pass-phrase program changes the passphrase protecting a private key or pkcs12 bundle containing a private key and certificate. by default, grid-change-pass-phrase uses the x509_user_key environment variable to locate the private key. if that is not set, then it looks for $home/.globus/userkey.pem and $home/.globus/usercred.p12 in succession. the path to a key can be specified by using the -file command-line option. the full set of command-line options to grid-change-pass-phrase are: -help, -usage display the command-line options to grid-change-pass-phrase and exit. -version,
grid-proxy-destroy	the grid-proxy-destroy program removes x.509 proxy files from the local filesystem. it overwrites the data in the files and removes the files from the filesystem. by default, it removes the current user's default proxy (either /tmp/x509up_uuid where uid is the current posix user id, or the file pointed to by the x509_user_proxy environment variable) unless a list of proxy file paths are included as part of the command line. use the -- command-line option to separate a list of proxy
grid-proxy-info	the grid-proxy-info program extracts information from an x.509 proxy certificates, and optionally displays or returns an exit code based on that information. the default mode of operation is to print the following facts about the current user's default proxy: subject, issuer, identity, type, strength, path, and time left. if the command-line option -exists or -e is included in the command-line, nothing is printed unless one of the print options is specified. instead, grid-proxy-info determines if a valid proxy exists and,
grid-proxy-init	the grid-proxy-init program generates x.509 proxy certificates derived from the currently available certificate files. by default, this command generates a rfc 3820 [1] proxy certificate with a 512 bit key valid for 12 hours in a file named /tmp/x509up_uuid. command-line options and variables can modify the format, strength, lifetime, and location of the generated proxy certificate. x.509 proxy certificates are short-lived certificates, signed usually by a user's identity certificate or another proxy certificate. the key associated with a proxy certificate

gunzip	gzip reduces the size of the named files using lempel-ziv coding (lz77). whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification times. (the default extension is -gz for vms, z for msdos, os/2 fat, windows nt fat and atari.) if no files are specified, or if a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed to the standard output. gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.
gv	postscript and pdf viewer.postscript and pdf viewer. 
gv-update-userconfig	gv-update-userconfig is a simple script to update an .gv config file to the current version of gv(1). you can specify a file which is used instead of .gv by using the optional filename argument. this is useful if the environment variable xusersearchpath is used. this is done by removing all entries known to cause problems with the current version of gnu gv (i.e. the one the version of this program belongs to) and updating the version information in that file.
gv2gxl	gxl2gv converts between graphs represented in gxl and in the gv language. unless a conversion type is specified using a flag, gxl2gv will deduce the type of conversion from the suffix of the input file, a ".gv" (or a ".dot") suffix causing a conversion from gv to gxl, and a ".gxl" suffix causing a conversion from gxl to gv. if no suffix is available, e.g. when the input is from a pipe, and no flags are used then gxl2gv assumes
gvcolor	gvcolor is a filter that sets node colors from initial seed values. colors flow along edges from tail to head, and are averaged (as hsb vectors) at nodes. the graph must already have been processed by dot. appropriate choice of initial colors yields drawings in which node colors help to emphasize logical relationships between nodes, even when they are spread far apart in the layout. initial colors must be set externally, using the color attribute of a node. it is
gvgen	gvgen generates a variety of simple, regularly-structured abstract graphs.gvgen generates a variety of simple, regularly-structured abstract graphs. 
gvhdl	freehdl is a compiler/simulator suite for the hardware description language vhdl. vhdl'93 as well as vhdl'87 standards are supported. freehdl translates the original vhdl source files into c++. then, the c++ source can be compiled and linked to the kernel to build the simulation program. starting the generated executable will simulate the corresponding vhdl model. the actual build process to generate the simulator from the vhdl source is a complex process which is handled by the gvhdl script. vhdl_files is
gvim	vim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. it can be used to edit all kinds of plain text. it is especially useful for editing programs. there are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc.. see ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between vim and vi. while running vim a lot of help can be obtained from

gvpack	gvpack reads in a stream of graphs, combines the graphs into a single layout, and produces a single graph serving as the union of the input graphs. the input graphs must be in dot format, and must have all necessary layout information. acceptable input is produced by applying a graphviz layout program, such as dot or neato, with no -t flag. by default, the packing is done at the cluster level. thus, parts of one graph will not intrude into
gvpr	gvpr is a graph stream editor inspired by awk. it copies input graphs to its output, possibly transforming their structure and attributes, creating new graphs, or printing arbitrary information. the graph model is that provided by libcgraph(3). in particular, gvpr reads and writes graphs using the dot language. basically, gvpr traverses each input graph, denoted by $g, visiting each node and edge, matching it with the predicate-action rules supplied in the input program. the rules are evaluated in order. for
gwenview	gwenview is an image viewer for kde. it features a folder tree window and a file list window to provide easy navigation of your file hierarchy. gwenview uses docked windows, so you can alter its layout any way you wish. you can also browse your images in full-screen mode, or embedded within konqueror using the gwenview image browser view and kpart. image loading is handled by the qt library, so gwenview supports all image formats your qt installation supports. gwenview
gxine	gxine plays mpeg system (audio and video) streams, mpeg elementary streams (e.g. .mp3, .mpa or .mpv files), mpeg transport streams, avi files, asf files, quicktime files, (s)vcds and dvds - anything which xine-lib can handle. typical usage looks liketypical usage looks like

gxl2dot	gxl2dot converts between graphs represented in gxl and in the dot language. unless a conversion type is specified using a flag, gxl2dot will deduce the type of conversion from the suffix of the input file, a ".dot" suffix causing a conversion from dot to gxl, and a ".gxl" suffix causing a conversion from gxl to dot. if no suffix is available, e.g. when the input is from a pipe, and no flags are used then gxl2dot assumes the type of
gxl2gv	gxl2gv converts between graphs represented in gxl and in the gv language. unless a conversion type is specified using a flag, gxl2gv will deduce the type of conversion from the suffix of the input file, a ".gv" (or a ".dot") suffix causing a conversion from gv to gxl, and a ".gxl" suffix causing a conversion from gxl to gv. if no suffix is available, e.g. when the input is from a pipe, and no flags are used then gxl2gv assumes
gzexe	the gzexe utility allows you to compress executables in place and have them automatically uncompress and execute when you run them (at a penalty in performance). for example if you execute ''gzexe /usr/bin/gdb'' it will create the following two files:-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 1026675 jun  7 13:53 /usr/bin/gdb -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 2304524 may 30 13:02 /usr/bin/gdb~ /usr/bin/gdb~ is the original file and /usr/bin/gdb is the self-uncompressing executable file. you can remove /usr/bin/gdb~ once you are sure
gzip	gzip reduces the size of the named files using lempel-ziv coding (lz77). whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification times. (the default extension is -gz for vms, z for msdos, os/2 fat, windows nt fat and atari.) if no files are specified, or if a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed to the standard output. gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.
h2pas	h2pas attempts to convert a c header file to a pascal unit. it can handle most c constructs that one finds in a c header file, and attempts to translate them to their pascal counterparts. see the constructs section for a full description of what the translator can handle.translate them to their pascal counterparts. see the constructs section for a full description of what the translator can handle. 
h2paspp	h2paspp reads one or more c header files and preprocesses them, writing the result to files with the same name as the originals as it goes along. it does not accept all preprocesser tokens of c, but takes care of the following preprocessor directives:does not accept all preprocesser tokens of c, but takes care of the following preprocessor directives: 
h2ph	h2ph converts any c header files specified to the corresponding perl header file format. it is most easily run while in /usr/include: cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*or cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/* arpa/* netinet/*or cd /usr/include; h2ph -r -l .the output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at perl's architecture dependent library directory. you can specify a different hierarchy with a -d switch. if run with no arguments, filters standard input to standard output.if run with no arguments, filters
h2root	h2root you can use to convert your hbook/paw histograms or ntuples files into root files. to use this program, you type the shell script command: h2root hbookfile rootfile if you do not specify the second parameter, a file name is automatically generated for you. if hbookfile is of the form file.hbook, then the root file will be called file.root. this program converts hbook histograms into root objects of the class th1f. hbook profile histograms are converted into root profile histograms
h2xs	h2xs builds a perl extension from c header files. the extension will include functions which can be used to retrieve the value of any #define statement which was in the c header files. the module_name will be used for the name of the extension. if module_name is not supplied then the name of the first header file will be used, with the first character capitalized. if the extension might need extra libraries, they should be included here. the extension makefile.pl
h8300-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
h8300-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
h8300-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
h8300-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
h8300-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
h8300-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
h8300-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
h8300-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
h8300-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
h8300-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
h8300-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
h8300-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

h8300-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
h8300-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
h8300-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
h8300-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
h8300-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
h8300-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
h8300-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

hunzip	hunzip is the decompression and decryption program of hzip format.hunzip is the decompression and decryption program of hzip format. 
hvectext	hvectext generates a geomview/oogl vector-text object, of given height or total length (default -s .25). it aligns the given 3-d point (default -at 0 0 0) with the given corner of the text (default -align c). alignment specs are like geographic directions; -align sw puts the ''at'' point at the ''southwest'' corner of the text, so that its lower left corner is at that coordinate. the corresponding vect object is written to standard output. if no non-blank text characters are
hvol	with no arguments, hvol displays the name and path to the "current" hfs volume as well as the names and paths of all previously mounted ("known") volumes. with an argument, hvol changes the current volume to be the one specified. either the name of the volume or the path to its unix source can be specified. the volume must have been previously mounted using hmount. a separate "current working directory" is maintained for each mounted volume. this information is kept
hwloc-assembler	hwloc-assembler combines the input xml topologies and exports the resulting global topologies to a new xml file. all inputs are inserting as children of the global root object. each input topology root is annotated with info attributes before insertion. assemblerindex is set to the index within the list of inputs. assemblername is set to the name given with --name if any. hwloc-assembler-remote offers a frontend for assembling remote nodes topologies without having to manually gather and transfer each of them.topologies

hwloc-bind	hwloc-bind execs an executable (with optional command line arguments) that is bound to the specified location (or list of locations). upon successful execution, hwloc-bind simply sets bindings and then execs the executable over itself. note: it is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page before reading this man page. most of the concepts described in hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-bind utility.directly apply to the hwloc-bind utility. 
hwloc-calc	hwloc-calc generates and manipulates cpu mask strings or objects. both input and output may be either objects (with physical or logical indexes), cpu lists (with physical or logical indexes), or cpu mask strings (always physically indexed). if objects or cpu mask strings are given on the command-line, they are combined and a single output is printed. if no object or cpu mask strings are given on the command-line, the program will read the standard input. it will combine multiple objects
hwloc-distances	hwloc-distances displays also distance matrices attached to the topology. a breadth-first traversal of the topology is performed starting from the root to find all distance matrices. note: lstopo may also display distance matrices in its verbose textual output. however lstopo only prints matrices that cover the entire topology while hwloc-distances also displays matrices that ignore part of the topology.while hwloc-distances also displays matrices that ignore part of the topology. 
hwloc-distrib	hwloc-distrib generates a series of cpu masks corresponding to a distribution of a given number of elements over the topology of the machine. the distribution is done recursively from the top of the hierarchy (or from the level specified by option --from) down to the bottom of the hierarchy (or down to the level specified by option --to, or until only one element remains), splitting the number of elements at each encountered hierarchy level not ignored by options --ignore. this
hwloc-gather-topology	hwloc-gather-topology saves all the relevant topology files into an archive (<path>.tar.bz2) and the lstopo output (<path>.output). the utility for example stores the /proc/cpuinfo file and the entire /sys/devices/system/node/ directory tree. these files can be used later to explore the machine topology offline. once the tarball has been extracted, it may for instance be given to some hwloc command-line utilities through their --input option. it is also possible to override the default topology that the hwloc library will read by setting
hwloc-info	lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics are capable of displaying a topological map of the system in a variety of different output formats. the only difference between lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics is that graphical outputs are only supported by lstopo, to reduce dependencies on external libraries. if no filename is specified and the display environment variable is set, lstopo displays the map in a graphical window. if no filename is specified and the display environment variable is not set, a text summary is displayed.
hwloc-ls	lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics are capable of displaying a topological map of the system in a variety of different output formats. the only difference between lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics is that graphical outputs are only supported by lstopo, to reduce dependencies on external libraries. if no filename is specified and the display environment variable is set, lstopo displays the map in a graphical window. if no filename is specified and the display environment variable is not set, a text summary is displayed.

hypertorus	the hypertorus program shows the clifford torus as it rotates in 4d. the clifford torus is a torus lies on the "surface" of the hypersphere in 4d. the program projects the 4d torus to 3d using either a perspective or an orthographic projection. of the two alternatives, the perspective projection looks much more appealing. in orthographic projections the torus degenerates into a doubly covered cylinder for some angles. the projected 3d torus can then be projected to the screen either
hzip	hunzip is a small utility for text file compression and encryption, especially for sorted dictionaries. "hunspell filename" creates the compressed file "filename.hz" without removing the original file. the compression algorithm uses 16-bit huffman encoding and line-oriented prefix-suffix compression. it has good compression ratio for huge sorted word lists.lists. 
i2f	i2f is a utility for converting iraf images to fits images. if you want to change the number of bits per pixel, use imrot. the bitpix, naxis, naxis1, naxis2, object, and pixfile keywords are set from the binary portion of the header. imhfile and pixfile are set from the actual filenames for internal purposes.are set from the actual filenames for internal purposes. 
i3	introduction i3 was created because wmii, our favorite window manager at the time, didn't provide some features we wanted (multi-monitor done right, for example), had some bugs, didn't progress since quite some time and wasn't easy to hack at all (source code comments/documentation completely lacking). still, we think the wmii developers and contributors did a great job. thank you for inspiring us to create i3. please be aware that i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers. important note
i3-config-wizard	i3-config-wizard is started by i3 in its default config, unless /.i3/config exists. i3-config-wizard creates a keysym based i3 config file (based on /etc/i3/config.keycodes) in /.i3/config. the advantage of using keysyms is that the config file is easy to read, understand and modify. however, if we shipped with a keysym based default config file, the key positions would not be consistent across different keyboard layouts (take for example the homerow for movement). therefore, we ship with a keycode based default config
i3-input	i3-input is a tool to take commands (or parts of a command) composed by the user, and send it/them to i3. this is useful, for example, for the mark/goto command.command. 
i3-ipc	i3-ipc can be used to communicate with i3, the improved tiling window manager, through the provided ipc socket. useful for scripting the window manager. currently implemented message types of i3 are the following:currently implemented message types of i3 are the following: 
i3-migrate-config-to-v4	i3-migrate-config-to-v4 is a perl script which migrates your old (< version 4) configuration files to a version 4 config file. the most significant changes are the new commands (see the release notes). this script will automatically be run by i3 when it detects an old config file. please migrate your config file as soon as possible. we plan to include this script in all i3 release until 2012-08-01. afterwards, old config files will no longer be supported.script in all i3
i3-msg	i3-msg is a sample implementation for a client using the unix socket ipc interface to i3. at the moment, it can only be used for sending commands (like in configuration file for key bindings), but this may change in the future (staying backwards-compatible, of course).configuration file for key bindings), but this may change in the future (staying backwards-compatible, of course). 
i3-nagbar	i3-nagbar is used by i3 to tell you about errors in your configuration file (for example). while these errors are logged to the logfile (if any), the past has proven that users are either not aware of their logfile or do not check it after modifying the configuration file.has proven that users are either not aware of their logfile or do not check it after modifying the configuration file. 
i3lock	i3lock locks your screen by making it white (default). to quit i3lock just enter your password.your password. 
i3status	i3status is a small program (less than 1000 sloc) for generating a status bar for dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. it is designed to be very efficient by issuing a very small number of systemcalls, as one generally wants to update such a status line every second. this ensures that even under high load, your status bar is updated correctly. also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging your cpu as much as spawning the corresponding amount of
i686-pc-mingw32-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
i686-pc-mingw32-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
i686-pc-mingw32-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
i686-pc-mingw32-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
i686-pc-mingw32-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
i686-pc-mingw32-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
i686-pc-mingw32-g++	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are

i686-pc-mingw32-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
i686-pc-mingw32-gfortran	the gfortran command supports all the options supported by the gcc command. only options specific to gnu fortran are documented here. all gcc and gnu fortran options are accepted both by gfortran and by gcc (as well as any other drivers built at the same time, such as g++), since adding gnu fortran to the gcc distribution enables acceptance of gnu fortran options by all of the relevant drivers. in some cases, options have positive and negative forms; the negative

lamcheckpoint	the lamcheckpoint tool checkpoints the lam software on each of the nodes that were initially booted with lamboot and/or lamgrow. lamcheckpoint calls the checkpoint function specific to the specified ssi module. the arguments to lamcheckpoint should contain the ssi parameter indicating the name of the checkpoint module at present, there are only two checkpoint modules namely, 'self' and 'blcr'. regardless of the checkpoint module selected, the pid of mpirun should be given as an argument to lamcheckpoint.lamcheckpoint. 
lamclean	the lamclean command attempts to remove all user processes and messages from all nodes. it also de-allocates all user allocated resources and cancels all user process registrations. this happens by invoking many different remote services which have previously been invoked individually by several other commands. these commands should still be used when partial selective removal of user presence is desired. otherwise, lamclean is a quick and convenient way of starting over after a bad application run without rebooting the system.
lamd	lam is an mpi programming environment and development system for a message-passing parallel machine constituted with heterogeneous unix computers on a network. with lam, a dedicated cluster or an existing network computing infrastructure can act as one parallel computer solving one compute-intensive problem. lam emphasizes productivity in the application development cycle with extensive control and monitoring functionality. the user can easily debug the common errors in parallel programming and is well equipped to diagnose more difficult problems. lam features a
lame	lame is a program which can be used to create compressed audio files. (lame ain't an mp3 encoder). these audio files can be played back by popular mp3 players such as mpg123 or madplay. to read from stdin, use "-" for <infile>. to write to stdout, use "-" for <outfile>.players such as mpg123 or madplay. to read from stdin, use "-" for <infile>. to write to stdout, use "-" for <outfile>. 
lament	the lament program draws an animation of a particular puzzle box repeatedly solving itself.the lament program draws an animation of a particular puzzle box repeatedly solving itself. 
lamexec	lamexec is essentially a clone of the mpirun(1), but is intended for non-mpi programs. one invocation of lamexec starts a non-mpi application running under lam. to start the same program on all lam nodes, the application can be specified on the lamexec command line. to start multiple applications on the lam nodes, an application schema is required in a separate file. see appschema(5) for a description of the application schema syntax, but it essentially contains multiple lamexec command lines, less
lamgrow	an existing lam universe, initiated by lamboot(1), can be enlarged to include more nodes with lamgrow. one new node is added for each invocation. at a minimum, the host name that will run the new node is given on the command line. if a different userid is required to access the host, it is specified with the appropriate boot ssi options (see lamssi_boot(7)). the new node can be assigned any unused, non-negative identifier. if no identifier is specified, the highest
lamhalt	the lamhalt tool terminates the lam software on each of the nodes that were initially booted with lamboot and/or lamgrow. no additional command line arguments are necessary - lamhalt simply sends a message to each remote node telling it to shut down. each remote node invokes tkill(1) locally to shut down. see tkill(1) for a description of how lam is terminated on each node. lamhalt may fail if one of the remote nodes has failed, and does not respond to
laminfo	the laminfo command is used to display information about a lam/mpi installation. particularly with the ssi run-time module selection system, the laminfo command can be useful to scripts and resource managers to determine the capabilities of the installed lam/mpi in order to pass run-time parameters to mpi programs. output can be displayed in a "pretty" format (i.e., suitable for human reading) and also in a parsable format (i.e., suitable for easy parsing by scripts or other automated mechanisms). there are
lamnodes	the lamnodes command is used to resolve lam node/cpu nomenclature to unix hostnames. it can be used to determine the current running configuration of the lam/mpi run-time environment, and generate a boot schema that can be used to launch lam in the future. by default, lamnodes will print out the node number, default ip name, cpu count, and per-node flags for each node in the running lam. gethostbyaddr(3) is used to obtain default hostnames. if gethostbyaddr(3) fails, the ip number
lamrestart	a mpi application can be restarted using lamrestart. lamrestart calls the module-specific restart function. if the selected ssi module is 'self', the ssi parameter specifying the arguments to be passed to mpirun should also be given as an argument to lamrestart. in case the 'blcr' checkpoint/restart module is specified as the 'cr' ssi parameter, the location of the context file should be passed as an argument to lamrestart.location of the context file should be passed as an argument to lamrestart.
lamshrink	an existing lam session, initiated by lamboot(1), can be shrunk to include less nodes with lamshrink. one node is removed for each invocation. at a minimum, the node id is given on the command line. once lamshrink completes, the node id is invalid across the remaining nodes (as can be seen by running lamnodes(1)). existing application processes on the target node can be warned of impending shutdown with the -w option. a lam signal (sigfuse) will be sent to these
lamtrace	the -t option of mpirun(1) and loadgo(1) allows the application to generate execution traces. these traces are first stored in a buffer within each application process. when the buffer is full and when the application terminates, the runtime buffer is flushed to the trace daemon (a structural component within the lam daemon). the trace daemon will also collect data up to a pre-compiled limit. beyond this limit, the oldest traces in will be forgotten in favor of the newer traces.
lamwipe	this command has been deprecated in favor of the lamhalt command. lamwipe should only be necessary if lamhalt fails and is unable to clean up the lam run-time environment properly. the lamwipe tool terminates the lam software on each of the machines specified in the boot schema, <bhost>. lamwipe is the topology tool that terminates lam on the unix(tm) nodes of a multicomputer system. it invokes tkill(1) on each machine. see tkill(1) for a description of how lam is terminated

llc	the llc command compiles llvm source inputs into assembly language for a specified architecture. the assembly language output can then be passed through a native assembler and linker to generate a native executable. the choice of architecture for the output assembly code is automatically determined from the input file, unless the -march option is used to override the default.the default. 
lli	lli directly executes programs in llvm bitcode format. it takes a program in llvm bitcode format and executes it using a just-in-time compiler, if one is available for the current architecture, or an interpreter. lli takes all of the same code generator options as llc, but they are only effective when lli is using the just-in-time compiler. if filename is not specified, then lli reads the llvm bitcode for the program from standard input. the optional args specified on the
llvm-ar	the llvm-ar command is similar to the common unix utility, "ar". it archives several files together into a single file. the intent for this is to produce archive libraries by llvm bitcode that can be linked into an llvm program. however, the archive can contain any kind of file. by default, llvm-ar generates a symbol table that makes linking faster because only the symbol table needs to be consulted, not each individual file member of the archive. the llvm-ar command
llvm-as	llvm-as is the llvm assembler. it reads a file containing human-readable llvm assembly language, translates it to llvm bitcode, and writes the result into a file or to standard output. if filename is omitted or is "-", then llvm-as reads its input from standard input. if an output file is not specified with the -o option, then llvm-as sends its output to a file or standard output by following these rules:rules: 
llvm-bcanalyzer	the llvm-bcanalyzer command is a small utility for analyzing bitcode files. the tool reads a bitcode file (such as generated with the llvm-as tool) and produces a statistical report on the contents of the bitcode file. the tool can also dump a low level but human readable version of the bitcode file. this tool is probably not of much interest or utility except for those working directly with the bitcode file format. most llvm users can just ignore this tool.

llvm-diff	llvm-diff compares the structure of two llvm modules, primarily focusing on differences in function definitions. insignificant differences, such as changes in the ordering of globals or in the names of local values, are ignored. an input module will be interpreted as an assembly file if its name ends in '.ll'; otherwise it will be read in as a bitcode file. if a list of global names is given, just the values with those names are compared; otherwise, all global values
llvm-dis	the llvm-dis command is the llvm disassembler. it takes an llvm bitcode file and converts it into human-readable llvm assembly language. if filename is omitted or specified as "-", llvm-dis reads its input from standard input. if the input is being read from standard input, then llvm-dis will send its output to standard output by default. otherwise, the output will be written to a file named after the input file, with a ".ll" suffix added (any existing ".bc" suffix will
llvm-extract	the llvm-extract command takes the name of a function and extracts it from the specified llvm bitcode file. it is primarily used as a debugging tool to reduce test cases from larger programs that are triggering a bug. in addition to extracting the bitcode of the specified function, llvm-extract will also remove unreachable global variables, prototypes, and unused types. the llvm-extract command reads its input from standard input if filename is omitted or if filename is -. the output is
llvm-ld	the llvm-ld tool takes a set of llvm bitcode files and links them together into a single llvm bitcode file. the output bitcode file can be another bitcode file or an executable bitcode program. using additional options, llvm-ld is able to produce native code executables. the llvm-ld tool is the main linker for llvm . it is used to link together the output of llvm front-end compilers and run "link time" optimizations (mostly the inter-procedural kind). the llvm-ld tools attempts
llvm-link	llvm-link takes several llvm bitcode files and links them together into a single llvm bitcode file. it writes the output file to standard output, unless the -o option is used to specify a filename. llvm-link attempts to load the input files from the current directory. if that fails, it looks for each file in each of the directories specified by the -l options on the command line. the library search paths are global; each one is searched for every input
llvm-nm	the llvm-nm utility lists the names of symbols from the llvm bitcode files, or ar archives containing llvm bitcode files, named on the command line. each symbol is listed along with some simple information about its provenance. if no file name is specified, or - is used as a file name, llvm-nm will process a bitcode file on its standard input stream. llvm-nm's default output format is the traditional bsd nm output format. each such output record consists of an
llvm-prof	the llvm-prof tool reads in an llvmprof.out file (which can optionally use a specific file with the third program argument), a bitcode file for the program, and produces a human readable report, suitable for determining where the program hotspots are. this program is often used in conjunction with the utils/profile.pl script. this script automatically instruments a program, runs it with the jit , then runs llvm-prof to format a report. to get more information about utils/profile.pl, execute it with the
llvm-ranlib	the llvm-ranlib command is similar to the common unix utility, "ranlib". it adds or updates the symbol table in an llvm archive file. note that using the llvm-ar modifier s is usually more efficient than running llvm-ranlib which is only provided only for completness and compatibility. unlike other implementations of "ranlib", llvm-ranlib indexes llvm bitcode files, not native object modules. you can list the contents of the symbol table with the "llvm-nm -s" command.object modules. you can list the contents

m32r-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
m32r-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
m32r-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
m32r-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
m32r-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
m32r-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
m32r-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
m32r-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
m32r-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

m32r-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
m32r-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
m32r-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
m32r-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
m32r-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
m32r-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents

(for example, "show slave status" on mysql). the first part is an instance of mk-heartbeat that connects to the master and updates a timestamp ("heartbeat record") every second with "--update". the second part is another mk-heartbeat instance that connects to the slave, examines the replicated heartbeat with "--monitor" or
mk-index-usage	this tool connects to a mysql database server, reads through a query log, and uses explain to ask mysql how it will use each query. when it is finished, it prints out a report on indexes that the queries didn't use. the query log needs to be in mysql's slow query log format. if you need to input a different format, you can use mk-query-digest to translate the formats. if you don't specify a filename, the tool reads from stdin
mk-kill	mk-kill captures queries from show processlist , filters them, and then either kills or prints them. this is also known as a "slow query sniper" in some circles. the idea is to watch for queries that might be consuming too many resources, and kill them. for brevity, we talk about killing queries, but they may just be printed (or some other future action) depending on what options are given. normally mk-kill connects to mysql to get queries from show processlist
mk-loadavg	mk-loadavg watches a mysql server and takes action when a defined threshold is exceeded. one or more items can be watched including mysql status values from show status , show innodb status and show slave status , the three system load averages from "uptime", and values from "vmstat". watched items and their threshold values are specified by "--watch". every item is checked at intervals (see "--interval"). by default, if any one item's check returns true (i.e. its threshold is exceeded),
mk-log-player	mk-log-player does two things: it splits mysql query logs into session files and it plays (executes) queries in session files on a mysql server. only session files can be played; slow logs cannot be played directly without being split. a session is a group of queries from the slow log that all share a common attribute, usually thread_id. the common attribute is specified with "--split". multiple sessions are saved into a single sesssion file. see "--session-files", "--max-sessions", "--base-file-name" and "--base-dir".
mk-merge-mqd-results	this is a light-weight script for merging and reporting on results saved by mk-query-digest --save-results.this is a light-weight script for merging and reporting on results saved by mk-query-digest --save-results. 
mk-parallel-dump	mk-parallel-dump connects to a mysql server, finds database and table names, and dumps them in parallel for speed. only tables and data are dumped; view definitions or any kind of stored code (triggers, events, routines, procedures, etc.) are not dumped. however, if you dump the "mysql" database, you'll be dumping the stored routines anyway. exit status is 0 if everything went well, 1 if any chunks failed, and any other value indicates an internal error. to dump all tables to
mk-parallel-restore	mk-parallel-restore is a way to load sql or delimited-file dumps into mysql in parallel at high speed. it is especially designed for restoring files dumped by mk-parallel-dump. it automatically detects whether a file contains sql or delimited data from the filename extension, and either shells out to "mysql" or executes "load data infile" with the file. on unix-like systems, it will even make a fifo to decompress gzipped files for "load data infile". by default it discovers all files in
mk-profile-compact	mk-profile-compact slices and aligns the output from mk-query-profiler so you can compare profile results side by side easily. it prints the first profile result intact, but each subsequent result is trimmed to be as narrow as possible, then aligned next to the first. you can also use this to examine only some profile results. for example, if you have a set of queries to get a table into a known state, and then a query you want to profile, you
mk-purge-logs	mk-purge-logs purges binary logs on a master based on "--purge-rules" by executing "purge binary logs to".mk-purge-logs purges binary logs on a master based on "--purge-rules" by executing "purge binary logs to". 
mk-query-advisor	mk-query-advisor examines queries and applies rules to them, trying to find queries that look bad according to the rules. it reports on queries that match the rules, so you can find bad practices or hidden problems in your sql . by default, it accepts a mysql slow query log as input.input. 
mk-query-digest	this tool was formerly known as mk-log-parser. "mk-query-digest" is a framework for doing things with events from a query source such as the slow query log or processlist . by default it acts as a very sophisticated log analysis tool. you can group and sort queries in many different ways simultaneously and find the most expensive queries, or create a timeline of queries in the log, for example. it can also do a "query review," which means to save a
mk-query-profiler	mk-query-profiler reads a file containing one or more sql statements or shell commands, executes them, and analyzes the output of show status afterwards. it then prints statistics about how the batch performed. for example, it can show how many table scans the batch caused, how many page reads, how many temporary tables, and so forth. all command-line arguments are optional, but you must either specify a file containing the batch to profile as the last argument, or specify that you're
mk-show-grants	mk-show-grants extracts, orders, and then prints grants for mysql user accounts. why would you want this? there are several reasons. the first is to easily replicate users from one server to another; you can simply extract the grants from the first server and pipe the output directly into another server. the second use is to place your grants into version control. if you do a daily automated grant dump into version control, you'll get lots of spurious changesets for grants
mk-slave-delay	"mk-slave-delay" watches a slave and starts and stops its replication sql thread as necessary to hold it at least as far behind the master as you request. in practice, it will typically cause the slave to lag between "--delay" and "--delay"+"--interval" behind the master. it bases the delay on binlog positions in the slave's relay logs by default, so there is no need to connect to the master. this works well if the io thread doesn't lag the master much,
mk-slave-find	mk-slave-find connects to a mysql replication master and finds its slaves. currently the only thing it can do is print a tree-like view of the replication hierarchy. the master host can be specified using one of two methods. the first method is to use the standard connection-related command line options: "--defaults-file", "--password", "--host", "--port", "--socket" or "--user". the second method to specifiy the master host is a dsn . a dsn is a special syntax that can be either just
mk-slave-move	this tool knows how to disconnect and reconnect slaves to each other, compare replication positions, and so on. this makes it able to move a slave around the replication hierarchy safely and correctly. it doesn't do anything you can't do by hand, but it is tedious and error-prone to do this by hand. the hosts are given by a dsn . a dsn is a special syntax that can be either just a hostname (like "server.domain.com" or 1.2.3.4), or a
mk-slave-prefetch	mk-slave-prefetch reads the slave's relay log slightly ahead of where the slave's sql thread is reading, converts statements into "select", and executes them. in theory, this should help alleviate the effects of the slave's single-threaded sql execution. it will help take advantage of multiple cpus and disks by pre-reading the data from disk, so the data is already in the cache when the slave sql thread executes the un-modified version of the statement. "mk-slave-prefetch" learns how long it takes statements
mk-slave-restart	mk-slave-restart watches one or more mysql replication slaves and tries to skip statements that cause errors. it polls slaves intelligently with an exponentially varying sleep time. you can specify errors to skip and run the slaves until a certain binlog position. note: it has come to my attention that yahoo! had or has an internal tool called fix_repl, described to me by a past yahoo! employee and mentioned in the first edition of high performance mysql. apparently this tool does
mk-table-checksum	mk-table-checksum generates table checksums for mysql tables, typically useful for verifying your slaves are in sync with the master. the checksums are generated by a query on the server, and there is very little network traffic as a result. checksums typically take about twice as long as count (*) on very large innodb tables in my tests. for smaller tables, count (*) is a good bit faster than the checksums. see "--algorithm" for more details on performance. if you specify
mk-table-sync	mk-table-sync does one-way and bidirectional synchronization of table data. it does not synchronize table structures, indexes, or any other schema objects. the following describes one-way synchronization. " bidirectional syncing " is described later. this tool is complex and functions in several different ways. to use it safely and effectively, you should understand three things: the purpose of "--replicate", finding differences, and specifying hosts. these three concepts are closely related and determine how the tool will run. the following is the
mk-upgrade	mk-upgrade executes queries from slowlogs on one or more mysql server to find differences in query time, warnings, results, and other aspects of the querys' execution. this helps to evaluate upgrades, migrations and configuration changes. the comparisons specified by "--compare" determine what differences can be found. a report is printed which outlines all the differences found; see " output " below. the first dsn (host) specified on the command line is authoritative; it defines the results to which the other
mk-variable-advisor	mk-variable-advisor examines "show variables" for bad values and settings according to the " rules " described below. it reports on variables that match the rules, so you can find bad settings in your mysql server. at the time of this release, mk-variable-advisor only examples "show variables", but other input sources are planned like "show status" and "show slave status".and "show slave status". 
mk-visual-explain	mk-visual-explain reverse-engineers mysql's explain output into a query execution plan, which it then formats as a left-deep tree -- the same way the plan is represented inside mysql. it is possible to do this by hand, or to read explain 's output directly, but it requires patience and expertise. many people find a tree representation more understandable. you can pipe input into mk-visual-explain or specify a filename at the command line, including the magical '-' filename, which will read from
mk_cmds	mk_cmds converts a table listing command names and associated help messages into a c source file suitable for use with the ss(3) library. the source file name must end with a suffix of ''.ct''; the file consists of a declaration supplying the name of the command table: command_table name followed by entries of the form: [ request | unimplemented ] name, " string "[, abbrev]...; and a final end to indicate the end of the table. a c source file
mkaf	a collection of one or more performance co-pilot (see pcpintro(1)) archive logs may be combined with mkaf to produce a pcp archive folio and the associated archive folio control file. some pcp tools use mkaf to create archive folios, e.g. the ''record'' facility in the pmchart(1) and pmview(1) tools, to facilitate playback with pmafm(1). mkaf processes each filename argument, and if this is a component file from a pcp archive that archive is added to the folio. if filename is
mkbindic	mkbindic creates a binary-form dictionary (with extension .cbd or dicname) from a text-form dictionary textfile. with -c mkbindic creates old format dictionary. current supported versions are 3.0 and 3.7.creates old format dictionary. current supported versions are 3.0 and 3.7. 
mkbitmap	mkbitmap reads an image, and applies one or more of the following operations to it, in this order: inversion, highpass filtering, scaling, and thresholding. each operation can be individually controlled and turned on or off. the principal use of mkbitmap is to convert color or greyscale images into a format suitable as input for other programs, particularly the tracing program potrace(1). it is particularly useful for converting scanned line art, such as cartoons, handwritten text, etc., to high-resolution bilevel images.
mkbundle	mkbundle generates an executable program that will contain static copies of the assemblies listed on the command line. by default only the assemblies specified in the command line will be included in the bundle. to automatically include all of the dependencies referenced, use the "--deps" command line option. use mkbundlefp when you want the startup runtime to load the 1.0 profile, and use mkbundle2 when you want the startup runtime to load the 2.0 profile. for example, to create a
mkc_check_custom	mkc_check_custom takes a file and tries to compile or runs it. if file is an executable file, mkc_check_custom runs it and outputs 1 if it succeeded or 0 otherwise. if file is not executable, mkc_check_custom tries to compile and (if -r applied ) run a generated executable. again, if compilation/run succeeded, 1 is output, otherwise -- 0. what type of compiler to use depend on file extension. '.c' corresponds to ${cc} (c language), '.cc', '.cxx', '.c' and '.cpp' correspond to
mkc_check_decl	check_type is either define, variable, func[0-9], type or member. depending on its value mkc_check_decl checks for define, variable, function with specified number of arguments, type or a member of structure in a specified header files includes by compiling a test program. as a result it prints either 1 (success) or 0 (failure) to stdout.compiling a test program. as a result it prints either 1 (success) or 0 (failure) to stdout.

mkc_check_prog	mkc_check_prog takes a name and looks for the file with that name which would be executable. executable is searched for along the user's path. if appropriate executable is found, a path to it is printed. otherwise, an error message is printed and mkc_check_prog exits with error.appropriate executable is found, a path to it is printed. otherwise, an error message is printed and mkc_check_prog exits with error. 
mkc_check_sizeof	mkc_check_sizeof detects sizeof( type ) by compiling a test program. mkc_check_sizeof doesn't run a generated executable and therefore is ready for using a cross-compiler. headers are #include-d.ready for using a cross-compiler. headers are #include-d. 
mkcfm	there is usually only one cid font directory on the x font path. it is usually called /usr/x11r6/lib/x11/fonts/cid. if you do not specify an argument, mkcfm will try to go through the subdirectories of that directory, and create one summary of font metric files for each cidfont (character descriptions) file and each cmap (character maps) file it finds. the summaries of font metric files are put in the existing cfm subdirectory. the cfm subdirectories are created when cid-keyed fonts are

mkd2html	mkd2html utility parses a markdown(7)-formatted textfile (or stdin if not specified,) and generates a web page. it reads file or file.text and writes the result in file.html (where file is the passed argument.) mkd2html is part of discount.mkd2html is part of discount. 
mkdep	mkdep takes a set of flags for the c compiler and a list of c source files as arguments and constructs a set of include file dependencies which are written into the file ''.depend''. an example of its use in a makefile might be: cflags= -o -i../include srcs= file1.c file2.c depend: mkdep ${cflags} ${srcs} where the macro srcs is the list of c source files and the macro cflags is the list of flags for the c compiler.where the macro
mkdic	mkdic creates user dictionary named remote-dic in the user dictionary directory of the remote host, on which cannaserver(1m) is in operation. dictionary file name remote-dic is assigned to this file at this time. if the - and -l option isn't specified, mkdic creates an empty dictionary. if the - option is specified, the standard input will be used as the dictionary file. if the -l option is specified, local-file will be used as the dictionary file. if the user dictionary
mkdir	create the directory(ies), if they do not already exist.create the directory(ies), if they do not already exist. 
mkdirhier	the mkdirhier command creates the specified directories. unlike mkdir if any of the parent directories of the specified directory do not exist, it creates them as well.directories of the specified directory do not exist, it creates them as well. 
mkeot	the mkeot command writes an eot (embedded opentype) file on standard output that contains the given font file (opentype or truetype) and the given urls. mkeot handles truetype files, opentype files with truetype outlines, and opentype files with postscript outlines. (technically: all files with the "sfnt" format.) however, microsoft's web browser internet explorer (version 8) cannot handle postscript outlines. to use eot files with that browser, opentype files with postscript outlines must be converted to truetype files first. several prgrams
mkfifo	create named pipes (fifos) with the given names.create named pipes (fifos) with the given names. 
mkfontdir	for each directory argument, mkfontdir reads all of the font files in the directory searching for properties named "font", or (failing that) the name of the file stripped of its suffix. these are converted to lower case and used as font names, and, along with the name of the font file, are written out to the file "fonts.dir" in the directory. the x server and font server use "fonts.dir" to find font files. the kinds of font files read by
mkfontscale	for each directory argument, mkfontscale reads all of the scalable font files in the directory. for every font file found, an x11 font name (xlfd) is generated, and is written together with the file name to a file fonts.scale in the directory. the resulting fonts.scale file should be checked and possibly manually edited before being used as input for the mkfontdir(1) program.the resulting fonts.scale file should be checked and possibly manually edited before being used as input for the mkfontdir(1)

mkhtmlindex	the mkhtmlindex program generates index files for a directory of html-formatted manual pages. it searches for files whose names are of the form lqname.1.htmlrq, and outputs index files lqmanindex1.htmlrq, lqmanindex.2.htmlrq, and so on, one for each manual volume. empty index files will be removed. names and descriptions are found by scanning the first <h2> section of each page.volume. empty index files will be removed. names and descriptions are found by scanning the first <h2> section of each page. 
mkill	this is an alpha version of this program. please let me know what you think and what additional features would be nice. future version will most likely perform the same but have different output. one idea i've been thinking about is letting you specify filters which short perl snippets instead of just regexes. this program kills long running queries based on several criteria including query time, host, user, database, state, and query content. the following keys are active while mkill
mkimage	the mkimage command is used to create images for use with the u-boot boot loader. thes eimages can contain the linux kernel, device tree blob, root file system image, firmware images etc., either separate or combined. mkimage supports two different formats: the old, legacy image format concatenates the individual parts (for example, kernel image, device tree blob and ramdisk image) and adds a 64 bytes header containing information about target architecture, operating system, image type, compression method, entry points, time
mkindex	mkindex runs makeindex(1) on any index (cw.idx) or glossary (cw.glo) files created by texing the file basename.tex.mkindex runs makeindex(1) on any index (cw.idx) or glossary (cw.glo) files created by texing the file basename.tex. 
mkmanifest	the mkmanifest command is used to create a shell script (packing list) to restore unix filenames. its syntax is: mkmanifest [ files ] mkmanifest creates a shell script that aids in the restoration of unix filenames that got clobbered by the ms-dos filename restrictions. ms-dos filenames are restricted to 8 character names, 3 character extensions, upper case only, no device names, and no illegal characters. the mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used in pcomm, arc, and mtools to
mkmapfile	creates the binary mapfiles that module unicode::map uses for converting from and to unicode character sets.creates the binary mapfiles that module unicode::map uses for converting from and to unicode character sets. 
mkmupfnt	the mkmupfnt program creates an outfile that can be used with the mup "fontfile" statement to override a mup font. the postscript_font_name is the name of the font you want mup to use. this would be something that could be given as a name to the postscript findfont procedure. the mup_font_name is the name of the mup font you want to override, either an abbreviated name, like "pr" or a full name, like "palatino rom". the outfile is the file
mknod	create the special file name of the given type.create the special file name of the given type. 
mkocp	mkocp is used to create or recreate omega compiled process files (binary) from omega translation process (text) files. omega translation processes are used to translate one character set to another and to choose between characters with one or more context-sensitive variants. otps could also be used to change the case or hyphenation of text. otps are defined in text files, and compiled into binary code (ocps) using mkocp (this script) or directly with otp2ocp(1).otps are defined in text files, and

mkvmerge	this program takes the input from several media files and joins their streams (all of them or just a selection) into a matroska(tm) file; see the matroska(tm) website [1] .the matroska(tm) website [1] . 
mkvmerge-gui	mmg(1) is a wxwindows(tm) based gui for mkvmerge(1). it offers easy access to all of mkvmerge(1)'s options. all settings (e.g. source files, track options etc) can be saved and restored. included is a chapter editor that can read ogm style and xml style chapter files, write xml style chapter files and even read chapters from matroska(tm) files and write chapters directly to matroska(tm) files. included is also a header editor that can be used to quickly change properties of existing
mkvpropedit	this program analyses an existing matroska(tm) file and modifies some of its properties. then it writes those modifications to the existing file. among the properties that can be changed are the segment information elements (e.g. the title) and the track headers (e.g. the language code, 'default track' flag or the name). options: -l, --list-property-names-l, --list-property-names 
mkxauth	mkxauth aids in the creation and maintenance of x authentication databases (.xauthority files). use it to create a ~/.xauthority file or merge keys from another local or remote .xauthority file. remote .xauthority files can be retrieved via ftp (using ncftp(1)) or via rsh(1). for a slight measure of security, mkxauth does not create any temporary files containing authentication keys (although anyone spying on network packets can see the authentication key data as they pass through the network; for secure network

mkzftree	takes an input file tree (input) and create a corresponding compressed file tree (output) that can be used with an appropriately patched mkisofs(8) to create a transparent-compression iso 9660/rock ridge filesystem using the "zf" compression records.mkisofs(8) to create a transparent-compression iso 9660/rock ridge filesystem using the "zf" compression records. 
mlabel	the mlabel command adds a volume label to a disk. its syntax is: mlabel [-vcsn] [-n serial] drive:[new_label]mlabel displays the current volume label, if present. if new_label is not given, and if neither the c nor the s options are set, it prompts the user for a new volume label. to delete an existing volume label, press return at the prompt. reasonable care is taken to create a valid ms-dos volume label. if an invalid label is specified, mlabel changes
mlmmj-bounce	mlmmj-bounce is used to handle mails that are bouncing. when a mail arrives to the system, mlmmj-bounce will register in <listdir>/bounce/<addrstring> info about which number that bounced at what time. an example of such a line could be: 109:1094409801 # sun sep 5 20:43:21 2004 the above shows that message number 109 bounced 1094409801 seconds after epoch which is in human date stamps is sunday september 5th 20:43:21 2004. the last bounce mail recieved to the address is saved in
mlmmj-maintd	this is the program doing the maintenance for an mlmmj based mailing list. it will unsubscribe people who have bounced for long enough, send out bounce probes, resend mails that couldn't be delivered to relayhost, clean out stale requests for e.g. subscription, resend list mails and clean up leftover files etc. if a directory containing several lists exists, the -d can be used to specify this, making mlmmj-maintd perform a maintenance run in every listdir below the specified one. only
mlmmj-make-ml.sh	this is an interactive script which creates the mailing list directory and thus the list itself for being run by mlmmj.for being run by mlmmj. 
mlmmj-process	this is the binary which processes a mail. examples of what such processing is: access control using the access rules specified in <listdir>/control/access to perform access control to the list. this is done before headers are stripped, so one can create allow rules based on headers that are later stripped. header stripping headers specified in <listdir>/control/delheaders are deleted from the mail. header addition headers specified in <listdir>/control/customheaders are added to the mail. this could be headers like list-id: or reply-to:
mlmmj-recieve	the mlmmj-recieve binary is the one specified in the mailserver configuration file (aliases file), which writes the mail to the <listdir>/incoming directory and invokes mlmmj-process unless the -p option is specified. on systems using mailservers supporting the /etc/aliases file, a line to activate an mlmmj managed mailinglist would look like this: list: "|/usr/bin/mlmmj-recieve -l /var/spool/mlmmj/list/" it's very important to specify the full path to the binary, or the mailinglist will not function. when the -f option is used, it will
mlmmj-send	this binary is used to send all kinds of mail to mlmmj managed mailinglists, but can potentially be used standalone for sending mails. the only option that is not self explanatory is the -l list control option: '1' means 'send a single mail' this is used together with -f and -t to send one mail to one recipient.

myisam_ftdump	myisam_ftdump displays information about fulltext indexes in myisam tables. it reads the myisam index file directly, so it must be run on the server host where the table is located. before using myisam_ftdump, be sure to issue a flush tables statement first if the server is running. myisam_ftdump scans and dumps the entire index, which is not particularly fast. on the other hand, the distribution of words changes infrequently, so it need not be run often. invoke myisam_ftdump like this:invoke
myisamchk	the myisamchk utility gets information about your database tables or checks, repairs, or optimizes them. myisamchk works with myisam tables (tables that have .myd and .myi files for storing data and indexes). you can also use the check table and repair table statements to check and repair myisam tables. see section 13.7.2.3, "check table syntax", and section 13.7.2.6, "repair table syntax". the use of myisamchk with partitioned tables is not supported.the use of myisamchk with partitioned tables is not supported.
myisamlog	myisamlog processes the contents of a myisam log file. invoke myisamlog like this:invoke myisamlog like this: 
myisampack	the myisampack utility compresses myisam tables. myisampack works by compressing each column in the table separately. usually, myisampack packs the data file 40% to 70%. when the table is used later, the server reads into memory the information needed to decompress columns. this results in much better performance when accessing individual rows, because you only have to uncompress exactly one row. mysql uses mmap() when possible to perform memory mapping on compressed tables. if mmap() does not work, mysql falls
myproxy-change-pass-phrase	the myproxy-change-pass-phrase command changes the passphrase under which a credential is protected in the myproxy repository. the command first prompts for the current passphrase for the credential, then prompts twice for the new passphrase. only the credential owner can change a credential's passphrase. the user must have a valid proxy credential as generated by grid-proxy-init or retrieved by myproxy-logon(1) when running this command.by myproxy-logon(1) when running this command.

myproxy-logon	the myproxy-logon command retrieves a proxy credential from the myproxy-server(8) that was previously stored using myproxy-init(1) or myproxy-store(1). it can also be used to retrieve short-lived end entity credentials from a myproxy-server(8) configured to act as a certificate authority. in the default mode, the command prompts for the myproxy pass phrase associated with the credential to be retrieved and stores the retrieved credential in the location specified by the x509_user_proxy environment variable or /tmp/x509up_u<uid> if that environment variable is not
myproxy-retrieve	the myproxy-retrieve command retrieves a credential directly from the myproxy-server(8) that was previously stored using myproxy-init(1) or myproxy-store(1). unlike myproxy-logon(1), this command transfers the private key in the repository over the network (over a private channel). to obtain a proxy credential, we recommend using myproxy-logon(1) instead. in the default mode, the command prompts for the pass phrase associated with the credential to be retrieved and stores the retrieved credential in the standard location ( ~/.globus/usercert.pem and ~/.globus/userkey.pem). you could then
myproxy-store	the myproxy-store command uploads a credential to a myproxy-server(8) for later retrieval. the user must have a valid proxy credential as generated by grid-proxy-init or retrieved by myproxy-logon(1) when running this command. unlike myproxy-init(1), this command transfers the private key over the network (over a private channel). in the default mode, the command will take the credentials found in ~/.globus/usercert.pem and ~/.globus/userkey.pem and store them in the myproxy-server(8) repository. proxy credentials with default lifetime of 12 hours can then be
myrescue	myrescue is a program to rescue the still-readable data from a damaged harddisk. it is similiar in purpose to dd_rescue, but it tries to quickly get out of damaged areas to first handle the not yet damaged part of the disk and return later. the program tries to copy the device blockwise to a file and keeps a table ("block bitmap") noting whether a block has been successfully copied, not yet handled or has had errors. this block bitmap can
mysql	mysql is a simple sql shell with input line editing capabilities. it supports interactive and noninteractive use. when used interactively, query results are presented in an ascii-table format. when used noninteractively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in tab-separated format. the output format can be changed using command options. if you have problems due to insufficient memory for large result sets, use the --quick option. this forces mysql to retrieve results from the server a row at
mysql.server	mysql distributions on unix include a script named mysql.server. it can be used on systems such as linux and solaris that use system v-style run directories to start and stop system services. it is also used by the mac os x startup item for mysql. mysql.server can be found in the support-files directory under your mysql installation directory or in a mysql source distribution. if you use the linux server rpm package (mysql-server-version.rpm), the mysql.server script will be installed in
mysql_client_test	the mysql_client_test program is used for testing aspects of the mysql client api that cannot be tested using mysqltest and its test language. mysql_client_test_embedded is similar but used for testing the embedded server. both programs are run as part of the test suite. the source code for the programs can be found in in tests/mysql_client_test.c in a source distribution. the program serves as a good source of examples illustrating how to use various features of the client api. mysql_client_test is

ncdump	ncdump generates a text representation of a specified netcdf file on standard output. the text representation is in a form called cdl (''network common data form language'') that can be viewed, edited, or serve as input to ncgen. ncgen is a companion program that can generate a binary netcdf file from a cdl file. hence ncgen and ncdump can be used as inverses to transform the data representation between binary and text representations. see ncgen for a description of cdl
ncea	ncea performs gridpoint averages of variables across an arbitrary number (an ensemble) of input files, with each file receiving an equal weight in the average. each variable in the output-file will be the same size as the same variable in any one of the in the input-files, and all input-files must be the same size. whereas ncra only performs averages over the record dimension (e.g., time), and weights each record in the record dimension evenly, ncea averages entire files, and
ncecat	ncecat concatenates an arbitrary number of input files into a single output file. input files are glued together by creating a record dimension in the output file. input files must be the same size. each input file is stored consecutively as a single record in the output file. each variable (except coordinate variables) in each input file becomes one record in the same variable in the output file. coordinate variables are not concatenated, they are instead simply copied from the
ncflint	ncflint creates an output file that is a linear combination of the input files. this linear combination can be a weighted average, a normalized weighted average, or an interpolation of the input files. coordinate variables are not acted upon in any case, they are simply copied from file_1. there are two conceptually distinct methods of using ncflint. the first method is to specify the weight each input file is to have in the output file. in this method, the value
ncftp	the purpose of ncftp is to provide a powerful and flexible interface to the internet standard file transfer protocol. it is intended to replace the stock ftp program that comes with the system. although the program appears to be rather spartan, you'll find that ncftp has a wealth of valuable performance and usage features. the program was designed with an emphasis on usability, and it does as much as it can for you automatically so you can do what you
ncftpbatch	this program is responsible for processing background ftp requests. it is normally only run by ncftp and not manually by a human being, however you can run it to manually process the ftp job queue. the jobs are spool files written to a user's $home/.ncftp/spool directory and have a special format and file-naming convention (which contains when the job is to be run). ncftp runs this program when it needs to, but if the ncftpbatch daemon dies unexpectedly the jobs
ncftpget	the purpose of ncftpget is to do file transfers from the command-line without entering an interactive shell. this lets you write shell scripts or other unattended processes that can do ftp. it is also useful for advanced users who want to retrieve files from the shell command line without entering an interactive ftp program such as ncftp. one particularly useful feature of this program is that you can give it a uniform resource locator as the only argument and the
ncftpls	the purpose of ncftpls is to do remote directory listings using the file transfer protocol without entering an interactive shell. this lets you write shell scripts or other unattended processes that can do ftp. the default behavior is to print the directory listing in columnized format (i.e. ls -cf), but that is not very useful for scripting. this example uses the -1 flag, to print one file per line: $ ncftpls -1 ftp://ftp.ncftp.com/pub/ncftp/ you can also do a remote "ls
ncftpput	the purpose of ncftpput is to do file transfers from the command-line without entering an interactive shell. this lets you write shell scripts or other unattended processes that can do ftp. it is also useful for advanced users who want to send files from the shell command line without entering an interactive ftp program such as ncftp. by default the program tries to open the remote host and login anonymously, but you can specify a username and password information. the
ncftpspooler	the ncftpspooler program evolved from the ncftpbatch program. the ncftpbatch program was originally designed as a ''personal ftp spooler'' which would process a single background job a particular user and exit when it finished; the ncftpspooler program is a ''global ftp spooler'' which stays running and processes background jobs as they are submitted. the job queue directory is monitored for specially-named and formatted text files. each file serves as a single ftp job. the name of the job file contains
ncgen	ncgen generates either a netcdf-3 (i.e. classic) binary .nc file, a netcdf-4 (i.e. enhanced) binary .nc file or a file in some source language that when executed will construct the corresponding binary .nc file. the input to ncgen is a description of a netcdf file in a small language known as cdl (network common data form language), described below. if no options are specified in invoking ncgen, it merely checks the syntax of the input cdl file, producing error messages

obnam	obnam makes, restores, manipulates, and otherwise deals with backups. it can store backups on a local disk or to a server via sftp. every backup generation looks like a fresh snapshot, but is really incremental: the user does not need to worry whether it's a full backup or not. only changed data is backed up, and if a chunk of data is already backed up in another file, that data is re-used. the place where backed up data is placed
obnam-benchmark	obnam-benchmark benchmarks the obnam(1) backup application, by measuring how much time it takes to do a backup, restore, etc, in various scenarios. obnam-benchmark uses the seivot(1) tool for actually running the benchmarks, but makes some helpful assumptions about things, to make it simpler to run than running seivot directly. benchmarks are run using two different usage profiles: mailspool (all files are small), and mediaserver (all files are big). for each profile, test data of the desired total size is generated,
obnam-viewprof	obnam-viewprof shows a plain text version of python profiler output. you can generate such output from obnam by setting the obnam_profile environment variable to a filename. the profile will be written to that filename, and you should give it to obnam-viewprof as an argument. the sort-order argument defaults to cumulative and can be any of the orderings that the python pstats library supports. obnam-viewprof is mainly useful for those developing obnam(1).obnam-viewprof is mainly useful for those developing obnam(1). 
obprobe	the obprobe tool creates a grid around a molecule, placing a probe atom with a specified atom type and partial charge at each point to calculate the mmff94 energy. this can be used for docking experiments to test hydrogen-bond affinity, electrostatic potential, etc. output is sent to standard output using the gaussian cube format.gaussian cube format. 
obprop	the obprop program is a tool to print a set of standard molecular properties for all molecules in a file. it also serves as example code for using the open babel library (libopenbabel). output format includes: name [name] formula [formula] mol_weight [molecular weight] exact_mass [isotopic mass] canonical_smiles [string] num_atoms [number] num_bonds [number] num_residues [number] sequence [residue sequence] num_rings [number of rings (by sssr)] logp [number (octanol-water partition)] psa [number (topological polar surface area)] mr [number (molar refractivity)] $$$ the "$$$"
obrotamer	the obrotamer tool can be used as part of a conformational search by generating random isomers based on rotating dihedral angles. these rotamers are not conformers -- that is, obrotamer does not perform geometry optimization after generating the rotamer structure. the obminimize tool can do geometry optimization using molecular mechanics.optimization using molecular mechanics. 
obrotate	the obrotate program rotates the torsional (dihedral) angle of a specified bond in molecules to that defined by the user. in other words, it does the same as a user setting an angle in a molecular modelling package, but much faster and in batch mode (i.e. across multiple molecules in a file). the four atom ids required are indexes into the smarts pattern, which starts at atom 0 (zero). the angle supplied is in degrees. the two atoms used to
obxprop	obxprop is a tool for displaying the properties on an x window. this tool has a similar functionality to xprop, but obxprop allows you to see utf-8 strings as text. you may use the --id option to specify a window identifier, otherwise obxprop will allow you to select a window by clicking on it. primarily, this tool exists for openbox users to see the value of the _ob_app_name, _ob_app_class, _ob_app_role, and _ob_app_type properties, which openbox uses for matching windows against
ocaml	the ocaml(1) command is the toplevel system for objective caml, that permits interactive use of the objective caml system through a read-eval-print loop. in this mode, the system repeatedly reads caml phrases from the input, then typechecks, compiles and evaluates them, then prints the inferred type and result value, if any. the system prints a # (sharp) prompt before reading each phrase. a toplevel phrase can span several lines. it is terminated by ;; (a double-semicolon). the syntax of toplevel
ocamlbuild	ocamlbuild(1) orchestrates the compilation process of your ocaml project. it is similar in function to make(1) except that it is tailor-made to automatically compile most ocaml projects with very little user input. ocamlbuild should be invoked in the root of a clean project tree (e.g., with no leftover compilation files). given one or more targets to compile, it scans the required subdirectories to gather information about the various files present, running tools such as ocamldep(1) to extract dependency information, and
ocamlc	the objective caml bytecode compiler ocamlc(1) compiles caml source files to bytecode object files and links these object files to produce standalone bytecode executable files. these executable files are then run by the bytecode interpreter ocamlrun(1). the ocamlc(1) command has a command-line interface similar to the one of most c compilers. it accepts several types of arguments and processes them sequentially: arguments ending in .mli are taken to be source files for compilation unit interfaces. interfaces specify the names exported

ocamldebug	ocamldebug is the objective caml source-level replay debugger. before the debugger can be used, the program must be compiled and linked with the -g option: all .cmo and .cma files that are part of the program should have been created with ocamlc -g, and they must be linked together with ocamlc -g. compiling with -g entails no penalty on the running time of programs: object files and bytecode executable files are bigger and take longer to produce, but the executable
ocamldep	the ocamldep(1) command scans a set of objective caml source files (.ml and .mli files) for references to external compilation units, and outputs dependency lines in a format suitable for the make(1) utility. this ensures that make will compile the source files in the correct order, and recompile those files that need to when a source file is modified. the typical usage is: ocamldep options *.mli *.ml > .depend where .depend is the file that should contain the dependencies. dependencies
ocamldoc	the objective caml documentation generator ocamldoc(1) generates documentation from special comments embedded in source files. the comments used by ocamldoc are of the form (** ... *) and follow the format described in the the objective caml user's manual. ocamldoc can produce documentation in various formats: html, latex, texinfo, unix man pages, and dot(1) dependency graphs. moreover, users can add their own custom generators. in this manpage, we use the word element to refer to any of the following parts
ocamllex	the ocamllex(1) command generates objective caml lexers from a set of regular expressions with associated semantic actions, in the style of lex(1). running ocamllex(1) on the input file lexer.mll produces caml code for a lexical analyzer in file lexer.ml. this file defines one lexing function per entry point in the lexer definition. these functions have the same names as the entry points. lexing functions take as argument a lexer buffer, and return the semantic attribute of the corresponding entry point.
ocamlmktop	the ocamlmktop(1) command builds objective caml toplevels that contain user code preloaded at start-up. the ocamlmktop(1) command takes as argument a set of x.cmo and x.cma files, and links them with the object files that implement the objective caml toplevel. if the -custom flag is given, c object files and libraries (.o and .a files) can also be given on the command line and are linked in the resulting toplevel.-custom flag is given, c object files and libraries (.o and
ocamlopt	the objective caml high-performance native-code compiler ocamlopt(1) compiles caml source files to native code object files and link these object files to produce standalone executables. the ocamlopt(1) command has a command-line interface very close to that of ocamlc(1). it accepts the same types of arguments and processes them sequentially: arguments ending in .mli are taken to be source files for compilation unit interfaces. interfaces specify the names exported by compilation units: they declare value names with their types, define public

ocamlprof	the ocamlprof command prints execution counts gathered during the execution of a objective caml program instrumented with ocamlcp(1). it produces a source listing of the program modules given as arguments where execution counts have been inserted as comments. for instance, ocamlprof foo.ml prints the source code for the foo module, with comments indicating how many times the functions in this module have been called. naturally, this information is accurate only if the source file has not been modified since the
ocamlrun	the ocamlrun(1) command executes bytecode files produced by the linking phase of the ocamlc(1) command. the first non-option argument is taken to be the name of the file containing the executable bytecode. (that file is searched in the executable path as well as in the current directory.) the remaining arguments are passed to the objective caml program, in the string array sys.argv. element 0 of this array is the name of the bytecode executable file; elements 1 to n are
ocamlyacc	the ocamlyacc(1) command produces a parser from a lalr(1) context-free grammar specification with attached semantic actions, in the style of yacc(1). assuming the input file is grammar.mly, running ocamlyacc produces caml code for a parser in the file grammar.ml, and its interface in file grammar.mli. the generated module defines one parsing function per entry point in the grammar. these functions have the same names as the entry points. parsing functions take as arguments a lexical analyzer (a function from lexer

pamarith	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamarith reads two pbm, pgm, ppm, or pam images as input. it performs the specified binary arithmetic operation on their sample values and produces an output of a format which is the more general of the two input formats. the two input images must be of the same width and height. the arithmetic is performed on each pair of identically located tuples to generate the identically located tuple of the output. for the purpose
pambackground	this program is part of netpbm(1). pambackground reads a pnm or pam image as input. it generates as output a pam image that identifies the background area of the image (a mask). to identify the background, pambackground assumes the image is a foreground image, smaller than the total image size, placed over a single-color background. it assumes that foreground image is solid -- it does not have holes through which the background can be seen. so in specific, pambackground first
pambayer	this program is part of netpbm(1). pambayer reads a bayer pattern in a 1-deep netpbm image and produces a color image in pam rgb format as output. a bayer pattern is what you get from the optical sensor in some digital cameras. such a camera doesn't have a red, green, and blue sensor in the exact same place for an individual pixel. instead, it has red, green, and blue sensors laid out in a two dimensional array. the pattern in
pamchannel	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamchannel reads a pam or pnm image as input and produces a pam image as output, consisting of the indicated channels (planes) of the input. the output is the same dimensions as the input, except that the depth is the number of channum arguments you supply. the tuple type is a null string unless you specify the -tupletype option. this program works on multi-image streams, producing a corresponding output stream. but before netpbm 10.32
pamcomp	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamcomp reads two images and produces a composite image with one of the images overlayed on top of the other, possible translucently. the images need not be the same size. the input and outputs are netpbm format image files. in its simplest use, pamcomp simply places the image in the file overlay_file on top of the image in the file underlying_file, blocking out the part of underlying_file beneath it. if you add the -alpha
pamcut	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamcut reads a pam, pbm, pgm, or ppm image as input and extracts the specified rectangle, and produces the same kind of image as output. there are two ways to specify the rectangle to cut: arguments and options. options are easier to remember and read, more expressive, and allow you to use defaults. arguments were the only way available before july 2000. if you use both options and arguments, the two specifications get mixed
pamdeinterlace	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamdeinterlace removes all the even-numbered or odd-numbered rows from the input pnm or pam image. specify which with the -takeeven and -takeodd options. this can be useful if the image is a video capture from an interlaced video source. in that case, each row shows the subject 1/60 second before or after the two rows that surround it. if the subject is moving, this can detract from the quality of the image. because the
pamdepth	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamdepth reads a netpbm image as input, scales all the pixel values, and writes out the image with the new maxval. scaling the colors down to a smaller maxval will result in some loss of information. this program works on multi-image streams. be careful of off-by-one errors when choosing the new maxval. for instance, if you want the color values to be five bits wide, use a maxval of 31, not 32. one important
pamdice	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamdice reads a pam, pbm, pgm, or ppm image as input and splits it horizontally and/or vertically into equal size pieces and writes them into separate files as the same kind of image. you can optionally make the pieces overlap. see the -outstem option for information on naming of the output files. the -width and -height options determine the size of the output pieces. pamundice can rejoin the images. for finer control, you can
pamditherbw	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamditherbw dithers a grayscale image. dithering means turning each shade of gray into a pattern of black and white pixels that, from a distance, look the same as the gray. the input should be a pgm image or a pam image of tuple type grayscale. however, pamditherbw doesn't check, so if you feed it e.g. a ppm image, it will produce arbitrary results (actually, it just takes the first channel of whatever you give
pamedge	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamedge reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam) and produces an image that outlines the edges. the output image is of the same type as the input, except that the maxval of the output is at least 255 and if the input is pbm, the output is pgm. you can pipe the result through pamditherbw -threshold and play with the threshold value to get a pbm (bilevel image) of the edges. the edge detection
pamendian	this program is part of netpbm(1). all netpbm formats that have samples in pure binary format with multiple bytes are defined to have them in big endian (most significant byte first) order. however, there exist variations on these formats, primarily developed before official multibyte netpbm formats existed, that are identical to netpbm formats in every respect except that samples are in little endian (least signficant byte first) order. pamendian reverses the byte order of the sample to convert between the
pamenlarge	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamenlarge reads a netpbm image as input, replicates its pixels n times, and produces a netpbm image as output. the output is the same type of image as the input. if you enlarge by a factor of 3 or more, you should probably add a pnmsmooth step; otherwise, you can see the original pixels in the resulting image. pamenlarge can enlarge only by integer factors. the slower but more general pamscale can enlarge or
pamfile	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamfile reads one or more netpbm files as input and writes out short descriptions of the image type, size, etc. this is partly for use in shell scripts, so the format is not particularly pretty. by default, pamfile reads only the header of the input file. if that file is a pipe, that might cause problems for the process that is feeding the pipe. in that case, see the -allimages option.pipe. in that case,
pamfixtrunc	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamfixtrunc reads as much as it can of a netpbm image that may be truncated (i.e. the file may not contain the last part of the image) and writes out a valid netpbm image that is just missing the bottom rows of the original (pre-truncation) image. the header of a netpbm image implies how large the image must be (how many bytes the file must contain). if the file is actually smaller than that,
pamflip	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamflip flips a pam or pnm image top for bottom or left for right, or transposes it horizontal for vertical, or rotates it 1, 2, or 3 quarter turns. to rotate at other angles, use pnmrotate. it is much slower, though. the input image is pamfile, or standard input if pamfile is not specified. to flip/rotate a jfif (jpeg) image losslessly, use jpegtran. jpegtran is part of the independent jpeg group's compression library package,
pamfunc	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamfunc reads a netpbm image as input and produces a netpbm image as output, with the same format, maxval, and dimensions as the input. pamfunc applies a simple transfer function to each sample in the input to generate the corresponding sample in the output. the options determine what function. pamarith is the same thing for binary functions -- it takes two images as input and applies a specified simple arithmetic function (e.g. addition) on
pamgauss	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamgauss generates a one-plane pam image whose samples are a gaussian function of their distance from the center of the image. i.e. the sample value is highest in the center and goes down, in a bell curve shape, as you move away from the center. the values are scaled so that the volume under the surface of the two-dimensional gaussian function is the maxval of the image. you can use this image as a
pamgradient	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamgradient creates an image of the specified dimensions width by height which contains a smooth, two-dimensional gradient between the specified colors of the four corners (from top left to bottom right). specify the colors as described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine . if all four colors are gray values, pamgradient creates a grayscale image (pam tuple type grayscale). otherwise, it creates a color image (pam tuple type rgb).type rgb). 
pamlookup	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamlookup takes a two dimensional array of indices and a lookup table as input. for each position in the index array, it looks up the index in the lookup table and places the result of the lookup in the output image. the output thus has the same width and height as the index image, and tuple types determined by the lookup table. an index is either a whole number or an ordered pair of
pammasksharpen	this program is part of netpbm(1). pammasksharpen reads a netpbm image as input and produces a sharpened version of it, in the same format, as output. it does this via an unsharp mask, which you supply as another netpbm image. an unsharp mask is generally a blurred version of the original image. the sharpening computation is this: calculate the 'edgeness' of a sample in the input image as the signed difference between the sample value and the corresponding sample in
pammixinterlace	this program is part of netpbm(1). pammixinterlace is meant to operate on an image which is the interlacing of two images, where raster rows 0, 2, 4, etc. are from one image and rows 1, 3, 5, etc. are from another. (see below for why you might expect to encounter such an image). pammixinterlace makes each row of the output a mixture of the corresponding row of the input and its two neighbors. it uses half of the main row
pamoil	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamoil reads a netpbm image as input and does an 'oil transfer', and writes the same type of netpbm image as output. the oil transfer is described in 'beyond photography' by holzmann, chapter 4, photo 7. it's a sort of localized smearing. the smearing works like this: first, assume a grayscale image. for each pixel in the image, pamoil looks at a square neighborhood around it. pamoil determines what is the most common pixel
pamperspective	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamperspective reads a netpbm image as input and produces a netpbm image of the same format as output. pamperspective interprets the input image as a perspective projection of another image which is in a plane oblique to that of the input image. for example, a photograph of a painting, taken at an angle. the arguments upper_left_x ... lower_right_y specify a quadrilateral in the photograph that pamperspective assumes corresponds to a parallelogram in the painting.
pampick	this program is part of netpbm(1). pampick reads a pnm or pam image stream as input. it picks certain images from the stream and copies them to a new image stream on standard output. you identify the images to pick by sequence number within the stream. each image_sequence_number is a decimal sequence number, with zero meaning the first image. the arguments must be in increasing order, without duplicates. the results are undefined if they are not. (there are a number
pampop9	this program is part of netpbm(1). pampop9 tiles your starting image xtiles by ytiles times. each of these tiles is taken from a slightly different offset within the source, as determined by the xdelta and ydelta arguments. the top line of tiles in the output is taken from the top of the source image, the second starts with the ydelta row of the source image, the next with the 2*ydelta row, and so on. similarly, the first column of tiles
pamrgbatopng	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamrgbatopng reads a pam image with the rgb_alpha tuple type (a color visual image with transparency) and produces an equivalent png image as output. the input image if from the file named by the pamfile argument, or standard input if you don't specify pamfile. the output goes to standard output. the maxval of the input image must be 255. you can use pamdepth to change the maxval of an image to 255 if necessary.
pamscale	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamscale scales a netpbm image by a specified factor, or scales individually horizontally and vertically by specified factors. you can either enlarge (scale factor > 1) or reduce (scale factor < 1). the scale factorsthe scale factors 
pamseq	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamseq generates a pam image of a specified depth and specified maxval that consists of a single row. the row consists of one tuple of every possible value, in order. for a depth of one, the order is simple: from 0 to maxval, going from left to right. for higher depths, the highest numbered plane goes from 0 to maxval (going left to right) while all the other planes have value 0. then the
pamsharpmap	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamsharpmap reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam) and produces an image that shows how sharp it is at each location. sharpness is a measure of how suddenly (in space) colors change in the image. pamsharpmap computes the sharpness of each component color (r, g, b) separately and produces a pixel whose intensity of each component color is directly proportional to the sharpness of that component color at the same location in the input
pamsharpness	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamsharpness reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam) and prints a number that tells how sharp it is. sharpness is a measure of how suddenly (in space) colors change in the image. pamsharpness computes the sharpness of the image as the average difference in intensity between each pixel and its 8 surrounding pixels, in each of the color components (r, g, b). pamsharpness does not include the edges of the image, where there are
pamsistoaglyph	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamsistoaglyph reads a netpbm image as input and produces a netpbm image as output. pamsistoaglyph takes a single-image stereogram (sis) such as those produced by <a href= "http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pamstereogram.html">pamstereogram</a> and converts it to a red/cyan anaglyphic image such as those produced by ppm3d(1). many people have trouble tricking their eyes into focusing beyond the image in front of them and are therefore unable to perceive the 3-d shape hidden within a single-image stereogram. anaglyphic stereograms
pamslice	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamslice extracts one line of tuples (pixels) out of a netpbm image and prints their values in a table. a line means a row or column. it shows you a one-dimensional cross section of a two-dimensional image. (with the -plane option, it can be thought of as a one-dimensional cross-section of a three-dimensional image). the table has one line per tuple, consisting of blank-separated ascii decimal numbers. the first number is the column number
pamsplit	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamsplit reads a pnm or pam stream as input. it copies each image in the input into a separate file, in the same format. netpbmfile is the file specification of the input file, or - to indicate standard input. the default is standard input. output_file_pattern tells how to name the output files. it is the file specification of the output file, except that the first occurence of '%d' in it is replaced by the
pamstack	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamstack reads multiple pam or pnm images as input and produces a pam image as output, consisting of all the planes (channels) of the inputs, stacked in the order specified. for any one (but not more) of the input files, you may specify '-' to mean standard input. if you specify no arguments at all, the input is one file: standard input. the output is the same dimensions as the inputs, except that the
pamstereogram	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamstereogram inputs a height map (a map of the distances from your eye of the points in a scene) and outputs a single-image stereogram (sis). a sis is a 2-d image specially designed to appear three dimensional when viewed with relaxed, slightly unfocused eyes. what's exciting about single-image stereograms is that they don't require special glasses to view, although it does require a bit of practice to train your eyes to unfocus properly. the
pamstretch	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamstretch scales up pictures by integer values, either vertically, horizontally, or both. pamstretch differs from pamscale and pamenlarge in that when it inserts the additional rows and columns, instead of making the new row or column a copy of its neighbor, pamstretch makes the new row or column an interpolation between its neighbors. in some images, this produces better looking output. to scale up to non-integer pixel sizes, e.g. 2.5, try pamstretch-gen(1)instead. options let
pamstretch-gen	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamstretch-gen is a program which uses pamstretch(1), pnmfile(1),and pamscale(1)tosmoothlyscaleupapnmfile by any ratio; it's like a more general version of pamstretch (hence the name). but other than the 'any ratio' bit, it's much the same as pamstretch. :-)than the 'any ratio' bit, it's much the same as pamstretch. :-) 
pamsumm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamsumm reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam) and performs a summary function over all the samples in all the rows, columns, and planes and prints the result to standard output. pamsumm performs the operation on the actual sample values, not on the light intensities represented by them in the case that the image is a pgm or ppm image or pam equivalent. if you want to do arithmetic on light intensities of such
pamsummcol	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamsummcol reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam) and performs a summary function over all the rows in each column (sum, mean, etc.). it produces an image of the same kind that the same width and depth as the input, and one row high. its sample values are the result of the summary. pamsummcol performs the summary operation on each plane independently. pamsummcol performs the operation on the actual sample values, not on the
pamtester	test pluggable authentication module (pam) facility. service is the pam service name. user is the name of the user account to operate with the pam facility. the following operations are supported.supported. 
pamthreshold	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamthreshold thresholds a grayscale image. thresholding means dividing the image into background and foreground by comparing every pixel to a thresholding value. the input should be a pgm image or a pam image of tuple type grayscale or grayscale_alpha. however, pamthreshold doesn't check; it just thresholds the first channel as if it were grayscale samples and if there is a second channel, processes it as if it is an alpha (transparency) channel. so if
pamtilt	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtilt tries to find the correct angle for untilting (de-skewing) a scanned text document. the output is a single floating-point number (the angle in degrees) for use as the argument to pnmrotate. 'document skew' is the name given to what happens when you feed a page into an image scanner at an angle: the resulting image is tilted. pamtilt aims to correct that. pamtilt makes three iterations at successively finer increments, testing prospective rotation
pamtodjvurle	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtodjvurle reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam equivalent of pnm) as input and produces djvu color rle format as output.pamtodjvurle reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam equivalent of pnm) as input and produces djvu color rle format as output. 
pamtofits	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtofits reads a pnm or pam image as input and produces a fits (flexible image transport system) file as output. the resolution of the output file is either 8 bits/pixel, or 16 bits/pixel, depending on the value of maxval in the input file. if the input file is a pbm or pgm image, the output file consists of a single plane image (naxis = 2). if instead the input file is a ppm image,
pamtogif	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtogif reads a netpbm image as input and produces a gif file as output. this program creates only individual gif images. to combine multiple gif images into an animated gif, use gifsicle (not part of the netpbm package). pamtogif creates either an original gif87 format gif file or the newer gif89 format. it creates gif89 when you request features that were new with gif89, to wit the -transparent or -comment options. otherwise, it creates
pamtohdiff	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtohdiff takes a pam (or pnm) image as input and produced a horizontal difference image version of it as output. a horizontal difference image is one where the samples in each row indicate the difference between the sample value in the corresponding sample of the input image and the sample directly above it (in the previous row) in the input image. the horizontal difference image has the property that if a row of the
pamtohtmltbl	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtohtmltbl converts a visual image to an html table with one cell per pixel. the cell is empty, but its background color is that of the pixel. file is a pbm, pgm, ppm, or pam file. if pam, it must be a standard visual image of tuple type rgb, grayscale, or blackandwhite, or something equivalent with extra higher numbered channels, but pamtohtmltbl doesn't check the tuple type; it just assumes. note that the more
pamtojpeg2k	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtojpeg2k converts the named pbm, pgm, ppm, or pam file, or standard input if no file is named, to a jpeg-2000 code stream (jpc) file on standard output. the jpeg-2000 specification specifies two different formats: jp2 and jpeg-2000 code stream (jpc). jp2 represents a visual image quite specifically, whereas jpc is a more or less arbitrary array of codes. pamtojpeg2k can't produce a jp2, but the jpc image that pamtojpeg2k produces is very similar
pamtompfont	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtompfont reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam) and converts it to an mplayer bitmap font raster file. this is the original font format used by mplayer (for subtitles, on-screen messages, etc.), before it had the ability to use freetype to access standard fonts. the format was apparently an image format before mplayer adopted it for fonts, but i have no idea where it came from or where else it might be used. an
pamtooctaveimg	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtooctaveimg reads a netpbm image as input and produces a gnu octave image file as output. an octave image file (called 'octave's image format' in octave documentation) is a particular kind of octave data file. it describes two matrices:an octave image file (called 'octave's image format' in octave documentation) is a particular kind of octave data file. it describes two matrices: 
pamtopam	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtopam simply copies a pam image from standard input to standard output. this may seem an unnecessary duplication of cat, but remember that a pam program can read a pbm, pgm, or ppm image as if it were pam. so pamtopam can read either a pbm, pgm, ppm, or pam image and produce a pam image as output. even that is of limited usefulness because of the fact that almost any program to which
pamtopfm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtopfm reads a netpbm image (pnm or pam) and converts it to a pfm (portable float map) image. the pfm (portable float map) image format is a lot like ppm, but uses floating point numbers with no maxval to achieve a high dynamic range (hdr) format. that means it doesn't have a concept of absolute color and it can represent generic light intensity information rather than just visual information like ppm does. for example,
pamtopnm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtopnm reads a pam image as input and produces an equivalent pbm, pgm, or ppm (i.e. pnm) image, whichever is most appropriate, as output. pamtopnm assumes the pam image represents the information required for a pbm, pgm, or ppm image if its tuple type is 'blackandwhite', 'grayscale', or 'rgb' and its depth and maxval are appropriate. if this is not the case, pamtopnm fails. however, you can override the tuple type requirement with the
pamtosvg	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtosvg reads a pnm image as input and produce an svg (scalable vector graphics) image as output. thus, it traces curves in the input image and creates a set of splines that represent the image. svg is a vector image format, which means it describes curves that compose an image. by contrast, pnm is a raster format, which means it describes dots that compose an image. the main practical difference between the two types
pamtotga	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtotga reads a pbm, pgm, ppm, or pam image as input and produces a truevision targa file as output. the pam image may be either a blackandwhite, grayscale, rgb, or rgb_alpha image. to create a tga image with transparency (i.e. with an alpha mask), use rgb_alpha pam input. some netpbm programs that generate images with alpha masks generate them in that format. for another way to create the proper input stream, see pamstack(1). it
pamtotiff	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtotiff reads a pnm or pam image as input and produces a tiff file as output. actually, it handles multi-image netpbm streams, producing multi-image tiff streams (i.e. a tiff stream with multiple 'directories'). but before netpbm 10.27 (march 2005), it ignored all but the first netpbm image in the input stream. the output filethe output file 
pamtouil	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtouil reads a pnm or pam image as input and produces a motif uil icon file as output. if the input is pam, it may be either a regular grayscale or color image or grayscale+alpha or color+alpha. where the alpha channel is present, pamtouil renders pixels that are more than half transparent as transparent in the output. in the uil's colormap, pamtouil uses the color names from the rgb database -- the same one
pamtoxvmini	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamtoxvmini reads a netpbm image (pam or pnm) and produces an xv 'thumbnail' picture (a miniature picture normally generated by the 'visualschnauzer' browser) as output.browser) as output. 
pamundice	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamundice reads a bunch of pam, pbm, pgm, or ppm images as input and combines them as a grid of tiles into a single output image of the same kind on standard output. you can optionally make the pieces overlap. see the input_filename_pattern argument for information on naming of the input files. the input images must all have the same format (pam, ppm, etc.) and maxval and for pam must have the same depth
pamx	this program is part of netpbm(1). pamx displays a netpbm image in an x window system window. it is like a very simple version of the classic x image viewer xloadimage. if you don't specify the input file netpbm_file, the input is from standard input. the input image can be any netpbm image format. if the input is a multi-image stream, pamx ignores all but the first image. pamx is not the best choice for general purpose viewing of images,

perl	perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information. it's also a good language for many system management tasks. the language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). perl combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best features of c, sed, awk, and sh, so people familiar with those languages should have little difficulty with
perl.prov	this script calculates conventional name for each perl source file specified on a command line, based on its location relative to standard perl library paths; alternatively, a list of files is obtained from standard input, one file per line. *.pm, *.pl, and *.ph files are processed (*.pm files also suffer version extraction). the output of perl.prov is suitable for automatic dependency tracking (e.g. for rpm packaging). for example, /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/db_file.pm provides "perl(db_file.pm) = 1.810" (as of perl-5.8.6). perl.prov is a counterpart

perlboot	if you're not familiar with objects from other languages, some of the other perl object documentation may be a little daunting, such as perlobj, a basic reference in using objects, and perltoot, which introduces readers to the peculiarities of perl's object system in a tutorial way. so, let's take a different approach, presuming no prior object experience. it helps if you know about subroutines (perlsub), references (perlref et. seq.), and packages (perlmod), so become familiar with those first if you
perlbot	the following collection of tricks and hints is intended to whet curious appetites about such things as the use of instance variables and the mechanics of object and class relationships. the reader is encouraged to consult relevant textbooks for discussion of object oriented definitions and methodology. this is not intended as a tutorial for object-oriented programming or as a comprehensive guide to perl's object oriented features, nor should it be construed as a style guide. if you're looking for tutorials,
perlbs2000	this is a ported perl for the posix subsystem in bs2000 version osd v3.1a or later. it may work on other versions, but we started porting and testing it with 3.1a and are currently using version v4.0a. you may need the following gnu programs in order to install perl: gzip on bs2000gzip on bs2000 
perlbug	this program is designed to help you generate and send bug reports (and thank-you notes) about perl5 and the modules which ship with it. in most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command line without any special arguments and follow the prompts. if you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not part of the standard distribution), a binary distribution, or a non-core module (such as tk, dbi , etc), then please see
perlcall	the purpose of this document is to show you how to call perl subroutines directly from c, i.e., how to write callbacks. apart from discussing the c interface provided by perl for writing callbacks the document uses a series of examples to show how the interface actually works in practice. in addition some techniques for coding callbacks are covered. examples where callbacks are necessary includeexamples where callbacks are necessary include 
perlcc	perlcc creates standalone executables from perl programs, using the code generators provided by the b module. at present, you may either create executable perl bytecode, using the "-b" option, or generate and compile c files using the standard and 'optimised' c backends. the code generated in this way is not guaranteed to work. the whole codegen suite ("perlcc" included) should be considered very experimental. use for production purposes is strongly discouraged.experimental. use for production purposes is strongly discouraged.

perlclib	one thing perl porters should note is that perl doesn't tend to use that much of the c standard library internally; you'll see very little use of, for example, the ctype.h functions in there. this is because perl tends to reimplement or abstract standard library functions, so that we know exactly how they're going to operate. this is a reference card for people who are familiar with the c library and who want to do things the perl way; to

perlcommunity	this document aims to provide an overview of the vast perl community, which is far too large and diverse to provide a detailed listing. if any specific niche has been forgotten, it is not meant as an insult but an omission for the sake of brevity. the perl community is as diverse as perl, and there is a large amount of evidence that the perl users apply tmtowtdi to all endeavors, not just programming. from websites, to irc , to
perlcompile	perl has always had a compiler: your source is compiled into an internal form (a parse tree) which is then optimized before being run. since version 5.005, perl has shipped with a module capable of inspecting the optimized parse tree ("b"), and this has been used to write many useful utilities, including a module that lets you turn your perl into c source code that can be compiled into a native executable. the "b" module provides access to the parse
perlcritic	"perlcritic" is a perl source code analyzer. it is the executable front-end to the perl::critic engine, which attempts to identify awkward, hard to read, error-prone, or unconventional constructs in your code. most of the rules are based on damian conway's book perl best practices. however, "perlcritic" is not limited to enforcing pbp , and it will even support rules that contradict conway. all rules can easily be configured or disabled to your liking. this documentation only covers how to drive

perldbmfilter	the four "filter_*" methods shown above are available in all the dbm modules that ship with perl, namely db_file, gdbm_file, ndbm_file, odbm_file and sdbm_file. each of the methods work identically, and are used to install (or uninstall) a single dbm filter. the only difference between them is the place that the filter is installed. to summarise:to summarise: 
perldebguts	this is not the perldebug(1) manpage, which tells you how to use the debugger. this manpage describes low-level details concerning the debugger's internals, which range from difficult to impossible to understand for anyone who isn't incredibly intimate with perl's guts. caveat lector.internals, which range from difficult to impossible to understand for anyone who isn't incredibly intimate with perl's guts. caveat lector. 
perldebtut	a (very) lightweight introduction in the use of the perl debugger, and a pointer to existing, deeper sources of information on the subject of debugging perl programs. there's an extraordinary number of people out there who don't appear to know anything about using the perl debugger, though they use the language every day. this is for them.this is for them.

perldl	the program perldl is a simple shell (written in perl) for interactive use of pdl . it consists of a command-line interface that supports immediate interpretation of perl commands and expressions. perl expressions, including pdl constructs, can be entered directly at the keyboard and are compiled and executed immediately. the syntax is not exactly identical to perl, in that under most circumstances ending a line causes immediate execution of the command entered so far (no trailing ';' is required). the
perldoc	perldoc looks up a piece of documentation in .pod format that is embedded in the perl installation tree or in a perl script, and displays it via "pod2man | nroff -man | $pager". (in addition, if running under hp-ux, "col -x" will be used.) this is primarily used for the documentation for the perl library modules. your system may also have man pages installed for those modules, in which case you can probably just use the man(1) command. if you

perldsc	the single feature most sorely lacking in the perl programming language prior to its 5.0 release was complex data structures. even without direct language support, some valiant programmers did manage to emulate them, but it was hard work and not for the faint of heart. you could occasionally get away with the $m{$aoa,$b} notation borrowed from awk in which the keys are actually more like a single concatenated string "$aoa$b", but traversal and sorting were difficult. more desperate programmers even

perlfaq6	this section is surprisingly small because the rest of the faq is littered with answers involving regular expressions. for example, decoding a url and checking whether something is a number are handled with regular expressions, but those answers are found elsewhere in this document (in perlfaq9: "how do i decode or create those %-encodings on the web" and perlfaq4: "how do i determine whether a scalar is a number/whole/integer/float", to be precise). how can i hope to use regular expressions

perlfilter	this article is about a little-known feature of perl called source filters. source filters alter the program text of a module before perl sees it, much as a c preprocessor alters the source text of a c program before the compiler sees it. this article tells you more about what source filters are, how they work, and how to write your own. the original purpose of source filters was to let you encrypt your program source to prevent casual piracy.
perlfork	the fork() emulation is implemented at the level of the perl interpreter. what this means in general is that running fork() will actually clone the running interpreter and all its state, and run the cloned interpreter in a separate thread, beginning execution in the new thread just after the point where the fork() was called in the parent. we will refer to the thread that implements this child "process" as the pseudo-process. to the perl program that called fork(), all
perlform	perl has a mechanism to help you generate simple reports and charts. to facilitate this, perl helps you code up your output page close to how it will look when it's printed. it can keep track of things like how many lines are on a page, what page you're on, when to print page headers, etc. keywords are borrowed from fortran: format() to declare and write() to execute; see their entries in perlfunc. fortunately, the layout is much more legible,

perlfunc	the functions in this section can serve as terms in an expression. they fall into two major categories: list operators and named unary operators. these differ in their precedence relationship with a following comma. (see the precedence table in perlop.) list operators take more than one argument, while unary operators can never take more than one argument. thus, a comma terminates the argument of a unary operator, but merely separates the arguments of a list operator. a unary operator generally

perllexwarn	the "use warnings" pragma enables to control precisely what warnings are to be enabled in which parts of a perl program. it's a more flexible alternative for both the command line flag -w and the equivalent perl variable, $^w. this pragma works just like the "strict" pragma. this means that the scope of the warning pragma is limited to the enclosing block. it also means that the pragma setting will not leak across files (via "use", "require" or "do"). this

perlmint	there is a binary version of perl available from the freemint project http://freemint.de/ you may wish to use this instead of trying to compile yourself. the following advice is from perl 5.004_02 and is probably rather out of date. if you want to build perl yourself on mint (or maybe on an atari without mint) you may want to accept some advice from somebody who already did it... there was a perl port for atari st done by ++jrb bammi@cadence.com.

perlmodinstall	you can think of a module as the fundamental unit of reusable perl code; see perlmod for details. whenever anyone creates a chunk of perl code that they think will be useful to the world, they register as a perl developer at http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html so that they can then upload their code to the cpan . the cpan is the comprehensive perl archive network and can be accessed at http://www.cpan.org/ , and searched at http://search.cpan.org/ . this documentation is for people
perlmroapi	as of perl 5.10.1 there is a new interface for plugging and using method resolution orders other than the default (linear depth first search). the c3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as a plugin, without changing its perl-space interface. each plugin should register itself with "perl_mro_register" by providing the following structure struct mro_alg { av *(*resolve)(pthx_ hv *stash, u32 level); const char *name; u16 length; u16 kflags; u32 hash; };}; 
perlnetware	this file gives instructions for building perl 5.7 and above, and also perl modules for netware. before you start, you may want to read the readme file found in the top level directory into which the perl source code distribution was extracted. make sure you read and understand the terms under which the software is being distributed.terms under which the software is being distributed. 
perlnewmod	this document gives you some suggestions about how to go about writing perl modules, preparing them for distribution, and making them available via cpan . one of the things that makes perl really powerful is the fact that perl hackers tend to want to share the solutions to problems they've faced, so you and i don't have to battle with the same problem again. the main way they do this is by abstracting the solution into a perl module. if
perlnumber	this document describes how perl internally handles numeric values. perl's operator overloading facility is completely ignored here. operator overloading allows user-defined behaviors for numbers, such as operations over arbitrarily large integers, floating points numbers with arbitrary precision, operations over "exotic" numbers such as modular arithmetic or p-adic arithmetic, and so on. see overload for details.and so on. see overload for details.

perlpod	pod is a simple-to-use markup language used for writing documentation for perl, perl programs, and perl modules. translators are available for converting pod to various formats like plain text, html , man pages, and more. pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs: ordinary, verbatim, and command. ordinary paragraphordinary paragraph 
perlpodspec	this document is detailed notes on the pod markup language. most people will only have to read perlpod to know how to write in pod, but this document may answer some incidental questions to do with parsing and rendering pod. in this document, "must" / "must not", "should" / "should not", and "may" have their conventional (cf. rfc 2119) meanings: "x must do y" means that if x doesn't do y, it's against this specification, and should really be fixed.
perlport	perl runs on numerous operating systems. while most of them share much in common, they also have their own unique features. this document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes portable perl code. that way once you make a decision to write portably, you know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them. there is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular type of computer and taking advantage of a full range

perlrecharclass	the top level documentation about perl regular expressions is found in perlre. this manual page discusses the syntax and use of character classes in perl regular expressions. a character class is a way of denoting a set of characters, in such a way that one character of the set is matched. it's important to remember that matching a character class consumes exactly one character in the source string. (the source string is the string the regular expression is matched against.)
perlref	before release 5 of perl it was difficult to represent complex data structures, because all references had to be symbolic--and even then it was difficult to refer to a variable instead of a symbol table entry. perl now not only makes it easier to use symbolic references to variables, but also lets you have "hard" references to any piece of data or code. any scalar may hold a hard reference. because arrays and hashes contain scalars, you can now easily
perlreftut	one of the most important new features in perl 5 was the capability to manage complicated data structures like multidimensional arrays and nested hashes. to enable these, perl 5 introduced a feature called 'references', and using references is the key to managing complicated, structured data in perl. unfortunately, there's a lot of funny syntax to learn, and the main manual page can be hard to follow. the manual is quite complete, and sometimes people find that a problem, because it
perlreguts	this document is an attempt to shine some light on the guts of the regex engine and how it works. the regex engine represents a significant chunk of the perl codebase, but is relatively poorly understood. this document is a meagre attempt at addressing this situation. it is derived from the author's experience, comments in the source code, other papers on the regex engine, feedback on the perl5-porters mail list, and no doubt other places as well. notice ! it

perlretut	this page provides a basic tutorial on understanding, creating and using regular expressions in perl. it serves as a complement to the reference page on regular expressions perlre. regular expressions are an integral part of the "m//", "s///", "qr//" and "split" operators and so this tutorial also overlaps with "regexp quote-like operators" in perlop and "split" in perlfunc. perl is widely renowned for excellence in text processing, and regular expressions are one of the big factors behind this fame. perl

perlrun	the normal way to run a perl program is by making it directly executable, or else by passing the name of the source file as an argument on the command line. (an interactive perl environment is also possible--see perldebug for details on how to do that.) upon startup, perl looks for your program in one of the following places: 1. specified line by line via -e or -e switches on the command line. 2. contained in the file specified by
perlsec	perl is designed to make it easy to program securely even when running with extra privileges, like setuid or setgid programs. unlike most command line shells, which are based on multiple substitution passes on each line of the script, perl uses a more conventional evaluation scheme with fewer hidden snags. additionally, because the language has more builtin functionality, it can rely less upon external (and possibly untrustworthy) programs to accomplish its purposes.purposes. 
perlsolaris	this document describes various features of sun's solaris operating system that will affect how perl version 5 (hereafter just perl) is compiled and/or runs. some issues relating to the older sunos 4.x are also discussed, though they may be out of date. for the most part, everything should just work. starting with solaris 8, perl5.00503 (or higher) is supplied with the operating system, so you might not even need to build a newer version of perl at all. the sun-supplied
perlstyle	each programmer will, of course, have his or her own preferences in regards to formatting, but there are some general guidelines that will make your programs easier to read, understand, and maintain. the most important thing is to run your programs under the -w flag at all times. you may turn it off explicitly for particular portions of code via the "no warnings" pragma or the $^w variable if you must. you should also always run under "use strict" or
perlsub	like many languages, perl provides for user-defined subroutines. these may be located anywhere in the main program, loaded in from other files via the "do", "require", or "use" keywords, or generated on the fly using "eval" or anonymous subroutines. you can even call a function indirectly using a variable containing its name or a code reference. the perl model for function call and return values is simple: all functions are passed as parameters one single flat list of scalars, and
perlsymbian	this document describes various features of the symbian operating system that will affect how perl version 5 (hereafter just perl) is compiled and/or runs. note: this port (as of 0.4.1) does not compile into a symbian os gui application, but instead it results in a symbian dll . the dll includes a c ++ class called cperlbase, which one can then (derive from and) use to embed perl into applications, see symbian/readme. the base port of perl to symbian only
perlsyn	a perl program consists of a sequence of declarations and statements which run from the top to the bottom. loops, subroutines and other control structures allow you to jump around within the code. perl is a free-form language, you can format and indent it however you like. whitespace mostly serves to separate tokens, unlike languages like python where it is an important part of the syntax. many of perl's syntactic elements are optional. rather than requiring you to put parentheses
perlthanks	this program is designed to help you generate and send bug reports (and thank-you notes) about perl5 and the modules which ship with it. in most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command line without any special arguments and follow the prompts. if you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not part of the standard distribution), a binary distribution, or a non-core module (such as tk, dbi , etc), then please see
perlthrtut	this tutorial describes the use of perl interpreter threads (sometimes referred to as ithreads) that was first introduced in perl 5.6.0. in this model, each thread runs in its own perl interpreter, and any data sharing between threads must be explicit. the user-level interface for ithreads uses the threads class. note : there was another older perl threading flavor called the 5.005 model that used the threads class. this old model was known to have problems, is deprecated, and was

perltooc	when designing an object class, you are sometimes faced with the situation of wanting common state shared by all objects of that class. such class attributes act somewhat like global variables for the entire class, but unlike program-wide globals, class attributes have meaning only to the class itself. here are a few examples where class attributes might come in handy:here are a few examples where class attributes might come in handy:

(this is what professors call abstraction.) smart people who have nothing to do but sit around for weeks on end figuring out really hard problems make these nifty objects that

pg_controldata	pg_controldata prints information initialized during initdb, such as the catalog version. it also shows information about write-ahead logging and checkpoint processing. this information is cluster-wide, and not specific to any one database. this utility can only be run by the user who initialized the cluster because it requires read access to the data directory. you can specify the data directory on the command line, or use the environment variable pgdata.directory on the command line, or use the environment variable pgdata.
pg_ctl	pg_ctl is a utility for starting, stopping, or restarting the postgresql backend server (postgres(1)), or displaying the status of a running server. although the server can be started manually, pg_ctl encapsulates tasks such as redirecting log output and properly detaching from the terminal and process group. it also provides convenient options for controlled shutdown. in start mode, a new server is launched. the server is started in the background, and standard input is attached to /dev/null. the standard output and
pg_dump	pg_dump is a utility for backing up a postgresql database. it makes consistent backups even if the database is being used concurrently. pg_dump does not block other users accessing the database (readers or writers). dumps can be output in script or archive file formats. script dumps are plain-text files containing the sql commands required to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was saved. to restore from such a script, feed it to psql(1).
pg_dumpall	pg_dumpall is a utility for writing out (''dumping'') all postgresql databases of a cluster into one script file. the script file contains sql commands that can be used as input to psql(1) to restore the databases. it does this by calling pg_dump(1) for each database in a cluster. pg_dumpall also dumps global objects that are common to all databases. (pg_dump does not save these objects.) this currently includes information about database users and groups, tablespaces, and properties such as access
pg_resetxlog	pg_resetxlog clears the write-ahead log (wal) and optionally resets some other control information stored in the pg_control file. this function is sometimes needed if these files have become corrupted. it should be used only as a last resort, when the server will not start due to such corruption. after running this command, it should be possible to start the server, but bear in mind that the database might contain inconsistent data due to partially-committed transactions. you should immediately dump your
pg_restore	pg_restore is a utility for restoring a postgresql database from an archive created by pg_dump(1) in one of the non-plain-text formats. it will issue the commands necessary to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was saved. the archive files also allow pg_restore to be selective about what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being restored. the archive files are designed to be portable across architectures. pg_restore can operate in
pgawk	gawk is the gnu project's implementation of the awk programming language. it conforms to the definition of the language in the posix 1003.1 standard. this version in turn is based on the description in the awk programming language, by aho, kernighan, and weinberger, with the additional features found in the system v release 4 version of unix awk. gawk also provides more recent bell laboratories awk extensions, and a number of gnu -specific extensions. pgawk is the profiling version of
pgmabel	this program is part of netpbm(1). pgmabel reads as input a pgm image, which it assumes to be an image of a rotational symmetric transparent object. the image must have a vertical symmetry axis. pgmabel produces as output an image of a cross-section of the image. pgmabel does the calculation by performing the abel integration for deconvolution of an axial-symmetrical image by solving the system of linear equations. after integration, pgmabel weights all gray-values of one side by the surface
pgmake-db	this is a make tool using makefile::parser::gmakedb, makefile::ast, and makefile::ast::evaluator. this script is primary for testing the whole toolchain via running gnu make's official test suite. as of this writing, pgmake-db has already passed 51% of gnu make 3.81's test suite.as of this writing, pgmake-db has already passed 51% of gnu make 3.81's test suite.

pgmcrater	this program is part of netpbm(1). pgmcrater creates a pgm image which mimics cratered terrain. the pgm image is created by simulating the impact of a given number of craters with random position and size, then rendering the resulting terrain elevations based on a light source shining from one side of the screen. the size distribution of the craters is based on a power law which results in many more small craters than large ones. the number of craters of
pgmdeshadow	this program is part of netpbm(1). pgmdeshadow removes gray shadows from an image. this is useful for an image containing text, such as a scanned book pages, where a shadow typically appears near the book crease or near one side of the image. pgmdeshadow recognizes a gray shadow as an area of smoothly changing color, starting from the outer edges of the image. the program uses a simple image reconstruction algorithm to determine the local shadow gray level, then divides

pgmmedian	this program is part of netpbm(1). pgmmedian applies a median filter to a pgm image, using either the histogram sort or select kth value method to determine the median. see the -type and -cutoff options for information on how pgmmedian chooses between the two methods.see the -type and -cutoff options for information on how pgmmedian chooses between the two methods. 
pgmminkowski	this program is part of netpbm(1). pgmminkowski computes the 3 minkowski integrals of a pgm image. the minkowski integrals mathematically characterize the shapes in the image and hence are the basis of "morphological image analysis." hadwiger's theorem has it that these integrals are the only motion-invariant, additive and conditionally continuous functions of a two-dimensional image, which means that they are preserved under certain kinds of deformations of the image. on top of that, they are very easy and quickly calculated.
pgmmorphconv	this program is part of netpbm(1). pgmmorphconv performs morphological convolutions on a pgm image: dilation and erosion. pgmmorphconv performs a "topological" convolution. for each pixel of the input, pgmmorphconv generates an output pixel in the same position. to determine the intensity of the output pixel, pgmmorphconv lays the template image over the input image such that the middle pixel of the template is over the input pixel in question. pgmmorphconv looks at the input pixels underneath each white pixel in
pgmnoise	this program is part of netpbm(1). pgmnoise creates a pgm image that is made up of pixels of random brightness. the maxval is 255. you specify the dimensions of the image with the width and height arguments. the randomness in the image is limited before netpbm 10.37 (december 2006) -- if you run the program twice in the same second, you may get identical output.output.

pmdumplog	pmdumplog dumps assorted control, metadata, index and state information from the files of a performance co-pilot (pcp) archive log. the archive log has the base name archive and must have been previously created using pmlogger(1). normally pmdumplog operates on the distributed performance metrics name space (pmns), however if the -n option is specified an alternative local pmns is loaded from the file pmnsfile. if any metricname arguments appear, the report will be restricted to information relevant to the named performance
pmdumptext	pmdumptext outputs the values of performance metrics collected live or from a performance co-pilot (pcp) archive. by default, the metric values are displayed in tab separated columns, prefixed by a timestamp. unless directed to another host by the -h option, or to one or more archives by the -a option, pmdumptext will contact pmcd(1) on the local host to obtain the required information. pmdumptext may be run in interactive mode with the -i option which displays the values in equal
pmerr	pmerr accepts standard performance co-pilot (pcp) error codes via the code argument(s) and generates the corresponding error text. each code may be an integer, a hexadecimal value or a hexadecimal value prefixed by either ''0x'' or ''0x''. error codes must be less than zero, so if code is a positive number, a warning message is produced, and the negated value is used. the alternative use of the -l option causes all known error codes to be listed, along with their
pmeth	given a class name, print out all methods available to that class. it does this by loading in the class module, and walking its symbol table and those of its ancestor classes. a regular method call shows up simply: $ pmeth io::socket | grep '^con' confess configure connect connectedbut one that came from else where is noted with one or more "via" notations: destroy via io::handle export via exporter via io::handlea base-class method that is unavailable due to being hidden
pmevent	performance co-pilot (pcp) supports event records within the framework for fetching general performance information. pmevent prints current or archived values for the nominated event record metrics. the event records of interest are contained in one or more of the metrics identified by the metricname arguments. unless directed to another host by the -h option, or to an archive by the -a option or to a local context by the -l option, pmevent will contact the performance metrics collector daemon (pmcd)

pmfunc	given a fully-qualified function, this program opens up the file and attempts to cat out the source for that function.given a fully-qualified function, this program opens up the file and attempts to cat out the source for that function. 
pmgenmap	given one or more lists of metric names in infile or on standard input, pmgenmap generates c declarations and cpp(1) macros suitable for use across the performance metrics programming interface (pmapi) on standard output. the declarations produced by pmgenmap simplify the coding for client applications using the pmapi. the input should consist of one or more lists of metric names of the form listname { metricname1 symbolname1 metricname2 symbolname2 ... }which will generate c and cpp(1) declarations of the form
pmhostname	pmhostname reports the name of the host hostname as returned by gethostbyname(3n). if hostname is not specified, then the local host name is retrieved using gethostname(2) and this is than passed to gethostbyname(3n). pmhostname provides a service for shell scripts that mimics the logic used by performance co-pilot applications when trying to determine the official name of a host. if gethostbyname(3n) fails, the input host name (either hostname or the result from calling gethostname(2)) is reported.reported. 
pmie	pmie accepts a collection of arithmetic, logical, and rule expressions to be evaluated at specified frequencies. the base data for the expressions consists of performance metrics values delivered in real-time from any host running the performance metrics collection daemon (pmcd), or using historical data from performance co-pilot (pcp) archive logs. as well as computing arithmetic and logical values, pmie can execute actions (popup alarms, write system log messages, and launch programs) in response to specified conditions. such actions are extremely
pmie2col	pmie2col is a simple tool that converts output from pmie(1) into regular column format. each column is 7 characters wide (by default, may be changed with the -w option) with a single space between columns. that single space can be substituted with an alternate delimiter using the -d option (this is useful for importing the data into a spreadsheet, for example). the precision of the tabulated values from pmie can be specified with the -p option (default is 2 decimal
pmie_check	this series of shell scripts and associated control files may be used to create a customized regime of administration and management for the performance co-pilot (see pcpintro(1)) inference engine, pmie(1). pmie_daily is intended to be run once per day, preferably in the early morning, as soon after midnight as practicable. its task is to rotate the log files for the running pmie processes - these files may grow without bound if the ''print'' action is used, or any other pme

pmkdir	pmkdir creates a directory on a device connected through synce. forward slashes ('/') on the command line are converted to backward slashes ('\').forward slashes ('/') on the command line are converted to backward slashes ('\'). 
pmkpasswd	pmkpasswd is a little utility to generate crypted passwords for use with poe::component::server::irc "oper" blocks. it is basically a wrapper for the "mkpasswd" function provided by poe::component::server::irc::common. by default it produces passwords using perl's "crypt" function. the password is outputted on stdout .the password is outputted on stdout . 
pmlc	pmlc may be used to change those metrics and instances which a pmlogger(1) writes to a performance co-pilot archive (see pcpintro(1)), the frequency with which the metrics are collected and whether the logging is mandatory, advisory, on or off. it also reports the current logging status of metrics and instances. pmlc may be used to control pmlogger instances on remote hosts as well as those on the local host. normally pmlc operates on the distributed performance metrics name space (pmns),
pmload	given an argument of a module name, show all the files that are loaded directly or indirectly when the module is used at compile-time.given an argument of a module name, show all the files that are loaded directly or indirectly when the module is used at compile-time. 
pmlock	pmlock attempts to acquire an exclusive lock by creating file with a mode of 0. the exit status is 0 for success, 1 for failure. to release the lock, unlink file. in the event of a failure, the -v option produces an explanatory message on stdout.in the event of a failure, the -v option produces an explanatory message on stdout. 
pmlogcheck	pmlogcheck prints information about the nature of any invalid data which it detects in a pcp archive. of particular interest are wrapped values for metrics which are expected to have monotonically increasing values. the archive has the base name archive and must have been previously created using pmlogger(1). normally pmlogcheck operates on the default performance metrics namespace (pmns(4)), however if the -n option is specified an alternative namespace is loaded from the file pmnsfile. the command line options -s and
pmlogconf	pmlogconf may be used to create and modify a generic configuration file for the pcp archive logger, pmlogger(1). if configfile does not exist, pmlogconf will create a generic configuration file with a default set of enabled metrics and logging intervals. once created, configfile may be used with the -c option to pmlogger(1) to select performance metrics and specify logging intervals for a pcp archive. if configfile does exist, pmlogconf will prompt for input from the user to enable or disable
pmlogextract	pmlogextract reads one or more performance co-pilot (pcp) archive logs identified by input and creates a temporally merged and/or reduced pcp archive log in output. the nature of merging is controlled by the number of input archive logs, while the nature of data reduction is controlled by the command line arguments. the input(s) must be pcp archive logs created by pmlogger(1) with performance data collected from the same host, but usually over different time periods and possibly (although not usually)
pmlogger	pmlogger creates the archive logs of performance metric values that may be ''played back'' by other performance co-pilot (see pcpintro(1)) tools. these logs form the basis of the vcr paradigm and retrospective performance analysis services common to the pcp toolkit. the mandatory argument archive is the base name for the physical files that constitute an archive log. the -v option specifies the version for the archive that is generated. by default a version 2 archive is generated, and the only
pmlogger_check	this series of shell scripts and associated control files may be used to create a customized regime of administration and management for performance co-pilot (see pcpintro(1)) archive log files. pmlogger_daily , pmlogger_check , and pmlogger_merge are equivalent to the scripts cron.pmdaily, cron.pmcheck and cron.pmlogmerge which are deprecated but preserved on irix for backward compatibility. pmlogger_daily is intended to be run once per day, preferably in the early morning, as soon after midnight as practicable. its task is to aggregate and

pmlogger_merge	this series of shell scripts and associated control files may be used to create a customized regime of administration and management for performance co-pilot (see pcpintro(1)) archive log files. pmlogger_daily , pmlogger_check , and pmlogger_merge are equivalent to the scripts cron.pmdaily, cron.pmcheck and cron.pmlogmerge which are deprecated but preserved on irix for backward compatibility. pmlogger_daily is intended to be run once per day, preferably in the early morning, as soon after midnight as practicable. its task is to aggregate and
pmloglabel	pmloglabel verifies, reports on, and can modify all details of the labels in each of the files of a performance co-pilot (pcp) archive log. the archive log has the base name archive and must have been previously created using pmlogger(1). each of the files in a pcp archive (metadata, temporal index, and one or more data volumes) must contain a valid label at the start, else the pcp tools will refuse to open the archive at all. thus, the primary
pmlogreduce	pmlogreduce reads one performance co-pilot (pcp) archive identified by input (this must be a pcp archive created by pmlogger(1), pmlogextract(1) or pmlogreduce(1)), and creates a temporally reduced pcp archive in output. the data reduction involves statistical and temporal reduction of samples with an output sampling interval defined by the -t option in the output archive (independent of the sampling intervals in the input archive), and is further controlled by other command line arguments. for some metrics, temporal data reduction is
pmlogrewrite	pmlogrewrite reads a performance co-pilot (pcp) archive log identified by inlog and creates a pcp archive log in outlog. under normal usage, the -c option will be used to nominate a configuration file or files that contains specifications (see the rewriting rules syntax section below) that describe how the data and metadata from inlog should be transformed to produce outlog. the typical uses for pmlogrewrite would be to accommodate the evolution of performance metric domain agents (pmdas) where the names,
pmlogsummary	pmlogsummary prints statistical information about metrics of numeric type contained within the files of a performance co-pilot (pcp) archive log. the default output prints time averages for both counter and non-counter metrics. the archive log has the base name archive, typically created using pmlogger(1). the metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments. if metricname is a non-leaf node in the performance metrics name space (pmns(4)), then pmlogsummary will recursively descend the pmns and report on all leaf nodes.

pmmessage	pmquery provides a command-line-option compatible implementation of the xconfirm and xmessage tools, using a look-and-feel that is consistent with pmchart. several extensions to the functionality of the original tools have been made, in order to improve their specific utility for pmchart, but wherever possible the original semantics remain. pmconfirm displays a line of text for each -t argument specified (or a file when the -file argument is used), and a button for each -b argument specified. when one of the
pmnewlog	pmnewlog may be used to stop and restart a running instance of pmlogger(1). this is most useful for managing multiple sets of performance co-pilot (pcp) archive logs. these archive logs record the history of performance metric values that may be ''played back'' by other pcp tools, and they form the basis of the vcr paradigm and retrospective performance analysis services common to the pcp toolkit. in normal usage, pmnewlog would be executed by cron(1) in the wee hours to terminate
pmnsadd	pmnsmerge(1) performs the same function as pmnsadd and is faster, more robust and more flexible. it is therefore recommended that pmnsmerge(1) be used instead. pmnsadd adds subtree(s) of new names into a performance metrics name space (pmns), as used by the components of the performance co-pilot (pcp). normally pmnsadd operates on the default performance metrics namespace (pmns), however if the -n option is specified an alternative namespace is used from the file namespace. the default pmns is found in the
pmnscomp	pmnscomp compiles a performance metrics name space (pmns) in ascii format into a more efficient binary representation. pmloadnamespace(3) is able to load this binary representation significantly faster than the equivalent ascii representation. if outfile already exists pmnscomp will exit without overwriting it. by convention, the name of the compiled namespace is that of the root file of the ascii namespace, with .bin appended. for example, the root of the default pmns is a file named root and the compiled version
pmnsdel	pmnsdel removes subtrees of names from a performance metrics name space (pmns), as used by the components of the performance co-pilot (pcp). normally pmnsdel operates on the default performance metrics namespace (pmns), however if the -n option is specified an alternative namespace is used from the file namespace. the default pmns is found in the file $pcp_var_dir/pmns/root unless the environment variable pmns_default is set, in which case the value is assumed to be the pathname to the file containing the
pmnsmerge	pmnsmerge merges multiple instances of a performance metrics name space (pmns), as used by the components of the performance co-pilot (pcp). each infile argument names a file that includes the root of a pmns, of the formeach infile argument names a file that includes the root of a pmns, of the form 
pmount	pmount ("policy mount") is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits normal users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry. pmount also supports encrypted devices which use dm-crypt and have luks metadata. if a luks-capable cryptsetup is installed, pmount will use it to decrypt the device first and mount the mapped unencrypted device instead. pmount is invoked like this: pmount device [ label ] this will mount device to a directory below /media if policy is
pmpath	for each module name given as an argument, produces its full path on the standard output, one per line.for each module name given as an argument, produces its full path on the standard output, one per line. 
pmpost	pmpost will append the text message to the end of the performance co-pilot (pcp) notice board file ($pcp_log_dir/notices) in an atomic manner that guards against corruption of the notice board file by concurrent invocations of pmpost. the pcp notice board is intended to be a persistent store and clearing house for important messages relating to the operation of the pcp and the notification of performance alerts from pmie(1) when other notification options are either unavailable or unsuitable. before being written,
pmprobe	pmprobe determines the availability of performance metrics exported through the facilities of the performance co-pilot (pcp). the metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments. if metricname is a non-leaf node in the performance metrics name space (pmns(4)), then pmprobe will recursively descend the pmns and report on all leaf nodes. if no metricname argument is given, the root of the namespace is used. the output format is spartan and intended for use in wrapper scripts creating configuration files
pmproxy	pmproxy acts as a protocol proxy for pmcd(1), allowing performance co-pilot (pcp) monitoring clients to connect to one or more pmcd(1) instances via pmproxy. normally pmproxy is deployed in a firewall domain, or on a ''head'' node of a cluster where the ip (internet protocol) address of the hosts where pmcd(1) is running may be unknown to the pcp monitoring clients, although the ip address of the host where pmproxy is running is known to these clients. similarly, the clients
pmquery	pmquery provides a command-line-option compatible implementation of the xconfirm and xmessage tools, using a look-and-feel that is consistent with pmchart. several extensions to the functionality of the original tools have been made, in order to improve their specific utility for pmchart, but wherever possible the original semantics remain. pmconfirm displays a line of text for each -t argument specified (or a file when the -file argument is used), and a button for each -b argument specified. when one of the
pmsignal	pmsignal provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for use with tools from the performance co-pilot toolkit. it can be used to send a named signal (only hup, usr1, term, and kill are accepted). to one or more processes. the processes are specified using pid or the binary name (with -a option). if a signal is not specified, then the term signal will be sent. on linux and unix platforms, pmsignal is a simple wrapper around the kill(1) command. on windows,
pmsleep	pmsleep sleeps for interval. the interval argument follows the syntax described in pcpintro(1) for -t, and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer or floating point constant (the implied units in this case are seconds).simplest form may be an unsigned integer or floating point constant (the implied units in this case are seconds). 
pmsnap	pmsnap is a shell script that is normally run periodically from crontab(1) to generate graphic images of pmchart(1) performance charts. these images can be in any of the supported pmchart formats, including png, bmp, and jpeg, and may be incorporated into the content offered by the local web server. the -v option enables verbose tracing of the actions. by default pmsnap generates no output unless some error or warning condition is encountered. pmsnap generates images according to its control file,
pmsocks	pmsocks allows performance co-pilot (pcp) clients running on hosts located on the internal side of a tcp/ip firewall to monitor remote hosts on the other side of the firewall. this assumes the firewall has been configured with a compliant sockd daemon and the necessary access controls are satisfied.satisfied. 
pmstat	pmstat provides a one line summary of system performance every interval unit of time (the default is 5 seconds). pmstat is intended to monitor system performance at the highest level, after which other tools may be used to examine subsystems in which potential performance problems may be observed in greater detail. multiple hosts may be monitored by supplying more than one host with multiple -h flags (for live monitoring) or by providing a name of the hostlist file, where each
pmstore	under certain circumstances, it is useful to be able to modify the values of performance metrics, for example to re-initialize counters or to assign new values to metrics that act as control variables. pmstore changes the current values for the nominated instances of a single performance metric, as identified by metricname and the list of instance identifiers following the -i argument. instances must be a single argument, with elements of the list separated by commas and/or white space. by default
pmtime	pmtime is a graphical user interface for performance monitoring applications using the pcp infrastructure and requiring interactive time control. pmtime is not normally invoked directly by users. rather, it is more typical for it to be started by client applications (e.g. pmchart(1) and pmval(1)). there are two modes of interacting with a pmtime process - live host mode, and historical archive mode. in archive mode the window presents time controls suitable for manipulating the archive position, allowing full vcr control
pmtrace	pmtrace provides a simple command line interface to the trace performance metrics domain agent (pmda) and the associated pcp_trace library. the default pmtrace behavior is to provide point trace data to the trace pmda, using the tag argument as the identifying name associated with each trace point. the tag then becomes an instance identifier within the set of trace.point metrics. the -e option allows an arbitrary command to be executed. this command will be measured as a transaction since it

(unless -t option is used for translate only). use -c to cache the compiled perl script for next executions. if you use -f, pmumps will treat leading 8 spaces in a line as a leading tab.executions. if you use -f, pmumps will treat leading 8 spaces in a line as a leading tab. 
pmv	pmv renames or moves a file on a device connected through synce. forward slashes ('/') on the command line are converted to backward slashes ('\').forward slashes ('/') on the command line are converted to backward slashes ('\'). 
pmval	pmval prints current or archived values for the nominated performance metric. the metric of interest is named in the metricname argument, subject to instance qualification with the -i flag as described below. unless directed to another host by the -h option, or to an archive by the -a or -u options, pmval will contact the performance metrics collector daemon (pmcd) on the local host to obtain the required information. the metricname argument may also be given in the metric specification
pmvers	given one or more module names, show the version number if present. if more than one argument is given, the name of the module will also be printed. not all modules define version numbers, however.modules define version numbers, however.

png2ico	png2ico takes the input files and stores them in the output file as a windows icon resource. usually the input files would all represent the same image in different resolutions (common resolutions are 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64). a program reading the icon resource will pick the image closest to its desired resolution and will then scale it if necessary. using the parameter --colors you can specify the number of colors to use for the images that follow --colors on the
png2pat	png2pat is a program that converts an image file from png to pat format. infile.png is an rgb or rgba png file; the resulting .pat file is written to stdout. the file can be used with visgrep(1) to scrape screen content.content. 
png2swf	this tools converts png image files into an swf animation. it takes any number of input pictures, and converts them to swf one-by-one, where every converted picture is a seperate frame in the target swf. the way the images are encoded in swf is very similar to png (in that a zlib-based, lossless compression algorithm is used).the way the images are encoded in swf is very similar to png (in that a zlib-based, lossless compression algorithm is used). 
png2yuv	png2yuv decompresses a sequence of png files and pipes the image data to stdout as a yuv4mpeg2 stream. any 8bit/pixel png format supported by libpng can be read. stdout will be filled with the yuv4mpeg movie data stream, so be prepared to pipe it on to mpeg2enc or to write it into a file. this tool is incomplete. the alternative utility you are probably looking for is ppmtoy4m(1), which is also included in mjpegtools.this tool is incomplete. the alternative utility

pngtopam	this program is part of netpbm(1). pngtopam reads a png image (portable network graphics) as input and produces a netpbm image as output. the type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's black & white, pngtopam creates a pbm file. if it's grayscale, pngtopam creates a pgm file. otherwise, it creates a ppm file. except that with the -alphapam option, it always creates a pam file. that file has tuple type grayscale_alpha or rgb_alpha depending
pngtopnm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pngtopnm was obsoleted by pngtopam(1),introducedwithnetpbm10.44 (september 2008). pngtopam is backward compatible with pngtopnm, plus adds many additional functions, including the ability to produce a pam image that includes an alpha (transparency) channel. starting in release 10.48, pngtopnm is just an alias for pngtopam. pngtopnm remained in the netpbm package through release 10.47 because it may have fewer bugs than pngtopam in those releases, and may be faster in some environments. but pngtopnm's incompatibility with
pnm2ppa	reads portable anymap (pnm) format as input. binary pnm formats pnmraw = {ppmraw (color pixmap), pgmraw (graymap), and pbmraw (black-and-white bitmap)} are strongly preferred. output stream can be locally processed by hewlett-packard's printing performance architecture (ppa) printers (hp deskjet 710c, 712c, 720c, 722c, 820c, and 1000c series). (pnm format output can be produced from postscript(tm) input by the ghostscript output devices "pbmraw", "pgmraw" or "ppmraw", or by "pnmraw", which will choose one of these formats as appropriate for the document.)choose
pnmalias	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmalias reads a pnm image as input, and applies anti-aliasing to background and foreground pixels. if the input file is a pbm, pnmalias promotes the output anti-aliased image to a pgm, and prints a message informing the user of the change in format.promotes the output anti-aliased image to a pgm, and prints a message informing the user of the change in format. 
pnmarith	this program is part of netpbm(1). starting with netpbm 10.3, pnmarith is obsolete. use pamarith(1)instead. pamarith is backward compatible with pnmarith except where your input images have different depths. pnmarith would convert the one with the lesser depth to have the higher depth before doing the arithmetic. with pamarith, you must do that step separately, using pgmtoppm.the lesser depth to have the higher depth before doing the arithmetic. with pamarith, you must do that step separately, using pgmtoppm. 
pnmcat	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmcat reads one or more pnm images as input, concatenates them either left to right or top to bottom, and produces a single pnm image as output. to assemble a regular grid of images, you can use pamundice. to do the reverse, you might use pamdice to split an image up into smaller ones of equal size or pamcut to chop off part of an image or extract part of an image. pnmtile concatenates
pnmcolormap	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmcolormap reads a pnm or pam image as input, chooses ncolors colors to best represent the image and writes a pnm color map defining them as output. a pam image may actually contain tuples of any kind, but pnmcolormap's concept of the tuple values that best represent the ones present in the image may not make sense if the tuple type isn't rgb or grayscale. the design of the program, and the rest of
pnmcomp	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmcomp was obsoleted by pamcomp(1),introducedwithnetpbm10.21 (march 2004). pamcomp is backward compatible with pnmcomp, plus adds many additional functions, including the ability to process pam images, and tends to produce better transparency results. pnmcomp remains in the netpbm package because it may have fewer bugs for now than pamcomp, and is in some environments faster (but newer compilers have been seen to produce code for pamcomp significantly faster than that for pnmcomp). some day, pnmcomp
pnmconvol	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmconvol reads a netpbm images as input, convolves it with a specified convolution matrix, and writes a netpbm image as output. convolution means replacing each pixel with a weighted average of the nearby pixels. the weights and the area to average are determined by the convolution matrix (sometimes called a convolution kernel), which you supply in one of several ways. see convolution matrix . at the edges of the convolved image, where the convolution
pnmcrop	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmcrop reads a pbm, pgm, or ppm image as input, removes borders that are the background color, and produces the same type of image as output. if you don't specify otherwise, pnmcrop assumes the background color is whatever color the top left and right corners of the image are and if they are different colors, something midway between them. you can specify that the background is white or black with the -white and -black
pnmcut	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmcut was obsoleted by pamcut(1),introducedwithnetpbm9.20(may 2001). pamcut is backward compatible with pnmcut, plus adds many additional functions, including the ability to process pam images. pnmcut remained in the netpbm package until netpbm 10.46 (march 2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than pamcut due to its age. but now it would just be clutter. in netpbm before 9.20, use the manual for pamcut with pnmcut. features that are in pamcut but not
pnmdepth	this program is part of netpbm(1). starting with netpbm 10.32 (februrary 2006), pnmdepth is obsolete. use pamdepth(1)instead. pamdepth is backward compatible with pnmdepth. you can use the pamdepth manual for pnmdepth as long as you ignore features that were added after netpbm 10.31. for backward compatibility, the name 'pnmdepth' continues to exist as an alias for 'pamdepth'. but due to a bug, that name doesn't work in netpbm 10.32. you have to fix the symbolic link.have to fix the symbolic
pnmenlarge	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmenlarge was replaced in netpbm 10.25 (october 2004) by pamenlarge(1). pamenlarge is backward compatible with pnmenlarge, but works on pam images too.pamenlarge is backward compatible with pnmenlarge, but works on pam images too. 
pnmfile	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmfile was replaced in netpbm 10.9 (september 2002) by pamfile(1). pamfile is backward compatible with pnmfile, but works on pam images too.pamfile is backward compatible with pnmfile, but works on pam images too. 
pnmgamma	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmgamma performs gamma adjustment on pseudo-pnm images. the ppm format specification specifies that certain sample values in a file represent certain light intensities in an image. in particular, they specify that the sample values are directly proportional to luminance as defined by itu-r recommendation bt.709. bt.709 luminance as a function of radiance is a power function modified with a linear ramp near black. however, people sometimes work with approximations of ppm and pgm where
pnmhisteq	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmhisteq increases the contrast of a pgm or ppm image through the technique of 'histogram equalization.'[1] pnmhisteq computes a histogram of the luminosity of the pixels in the image. it then calculates a mapping between each luminosity and a new luminosity such that it spreads out intensity levels around histogram peaks and compresses them at troughs. i.e. it moves pixels around in the histogram so as to make it flat. it applies that mapping
pnmindex	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmindex creates an index image containing thumbnail (small) versions of a bunch of pnm files you supply. (akin to a photographic 'contact sheet.' pnmindex labels each thumbnail and, optionally, contains a title. if you just want to concatenate some images together in a grid, use pamundice for that. if you want to take apart the image you generated with pnmindex, use pamdice or pamcut.if you want to take apart the image you generated with
pnminterp	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnminterp was replaced in netpbm 9.21 (december 2001) by pamstretch(1). pamstretch is backward compatible with pnminterp, but also recognizes pam input, including that with an alpha channel.pamstretch is backward compatible with pnminterp, but also recognizes pam input, including that with an alpha channel. 
pnminvert	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnminvert reads a pnm image as input, inverts it black for white, and produces a pnm image as output. if the image is grayscale, pnminvert replaces a pixel with one of complementary brightness, i.e. if the original pixel has gamma-adjusted gray value g, the output pixel has gray value maxval - g. if the image is color, pnminvert inverts each individual rgb component the same as for a grayscale image.if the image is color,
pnmmargin	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmmargin adds a border around a pnm image.pnmmargin adds a border around a pnm image. 
pnmmercator	this program is part of netpbm(1). the pnmmercator utility, converts a rectangular projection worldmap to a mercator projection format, as used for maps.google.com and many other online maps. the map used as input for pnmmercator must have rows for -90 to 90 degrees latitude and columns for -180 to +180 degrees longitude. the file will typically be twice as wide as high, but this is not a requirement. the output file will be using the mercator projection and will get
pnmmontage	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmmontage packs images of differing sizes into a minimum-area composite image, optionally producing a c header file with the locations of the subimages within the composite image.subimages within the composite image. 
pnmnlfilt	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmnlfilt produces an output image where the pixels are a summary of multiple pixels near the corresponding location in an input image. this program works on multi-image streams. this is something of a swiss army knife filter. it has 3 distinct operating modes. in all of the modes pnmnlfilt examines each pixel in the image and processes it according to the values of it and its surrounding pixels. rather than using a square block
pnmnoraw	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmnoraw was replaced in netpbm 8.2 (march 2000) by pnmtoplainpnm(1),whichwasobsoletedby pnmtopnm in netpbm 10.23 (july 2004). pnmtoplainpnm was actually the same program; it was just renamed to make it clear that is just a format converter. pnmtopnm is more general, in that it can go both directions. pnmtopnm -plain is the same as pnmnoraw.pnmtopnm is more general, in that it can go both directions. pnmtopnm -plain is the same as pnmnoraw. 
pnmnorm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmnorm reads a pnm image (pbm, pgm, or ppm). it normalizes the contrast by forcing the brightest pixels to white, the darkest pixels to black, and linearly rescaling the ones in between; and produces the same kind of file as output. this is pretty useless for a pbm image. the program first determines a mapping of old brightness to new brightness. for each possible brightness of a pixel, the program determines a corresponding brightness
pnmpad	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmpad reads a pnm image as input and outputs a pnm image that is the input image plus black or white borders of the sizes specified. if you just need to convert an image to a certain size regardless of the original dimensions, pamcut with the -pad option may be a better choice. pnmmargin does essentially the same thing, but allows you to add borders of any color and requires all four borders to
pnmpaste	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmpaste reads two pnm images as input and inserts the first image (the "pasted image") into the second (the "base image") at the specified location, and produces a pnm image the same size and type as the base image as output. if you don't specify the second file, pnmpaste reads the base image from standard input. x and y specify the location in the base image at which to put the top left corner
pnmpsnr	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmpsnr reads two pbm, pgm, or ppm files, or pam equivalents, as input and prints the magnitude of difference between the two images as a peak signal-to-noise ratio (psnr) this metric is typically used in image compression papers to rate the distortion between original and decoded image. if the inputs are pbm or pgm, pnmpsnr prints the psnr of the luminance only. otherwise, it prints the separate psnrs of the luminance, and chrominance (cb
pnmquant	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmquant reads a pnm image as input. it chooses ncolors colors to best represent the image, maps the existing colors to the new ones, and writes a pnm image as output. all options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. you may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option. you may use either white space or equals signs between an option name and its value. this program is simply a
pnmremap	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmremap replaces the colors in an input image with those from a palette you specify. where colors in the input are present in the palette, they just stay the same in the output. but where the input contains a color that is not in the palette, pnmremap gives you these choices:stay the same in the output. but where the input contains a color that is not in the palette, pnmremap gives you these choices:
pnmrotate	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmrotate reads a pnm image as input. it rotates it by the specified angle and produces the same kind of pnm image as output. the input is the file named by pnmfile or standard input if you don't specify pnmfile. the output goes to standard output. the resulting image is a rectangle that contains the (rectangular) input image within it, rotated with respect to its bottom edge. the containing rectangle is as small as
pnmscale	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmscale was obsoleted by pamscale(1),introducedwithnetpbm10.20 (january 2004). pamscale is backward compatible with pnmscale, plus adds many additional functions, including the ability to process pam images. pnmscale remained in the netpbm package until netpbm 10.46 (march 2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than pamscale due to its age. but now it would just be clutter. in netpbm before 10.20, use the manual for pamscale with pnmscale. features that are in pamscale but
pnmscalefixed	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmscalefixed is like pamscale except that it uses fixed point arithmetic internally instead of floating point, which makes it run faster. in turn, it is less accurate and may distort the image. it also lacks many of the features of pamscale. use the pamscale user manual with pnmscalefixed. this document only describes the difference. avoid any feature mentioned in the pamscale manual as not existing before netpbm 9.9. pnmscalefixed uses fixed point 12 bit
pnmshear	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmshear reads a pnm image as input and shears it by the specified angle and produce a pnm image as output. if the input file is in color, the output will be too, otherwise it will be grayscale. the angle is in degrees (floating point), and measures this: +-------+  +-------+ |       |  |\       \ |  old  | 
pnmsmooth	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmsmooth smoothes out an image by replacing each pixel with the average of its width x height neighbors. it is implemented as a progam that generates a pgm convolution matrix and then invokes pnmconvol with it.generates a pgm convolution matrix and then invokes pnmconvol with it. 
pnmsplit	this program is part of netpbm(1). starting with netpbm 10.31 (december 2005), pnmsplit is obsolete. use pamsplit(1)instead. pamsplit is backward compatible with pnmsplit. you can use the pamsplit manual for pnmsplit as long as you ignore features that were added after netpbm 10.30.were added after netpbm 10.30. 
pnmstitch	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmstitch stitches together two panoramic photographs. this means if you have photographs of the left and right side of something that is too big for a single camera frame, pnmstitch can join them into one wide picture. pnmstitch works only on side-by-side images, not top and bottom (though you could certainly use pamflip in combination with pnmstitch to achieve this). it stitches together two images, but you can use it repeatedly to stitch together
pnmtile	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtile reads a pnm image as input. replicates it to fill an area of the specified dimensions and produces an image in the same format as output. you can do pretty much the reverse with pamdice. you can explicitly concatenate an image to itself (or anything else) with pnmcat. if you're trying to tile multiple images into a superimage, see pamundice or (for a thumbnail sheet) pnmindex.if you're trying to tile multiple images into
pnmtoddif	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtoddif takes a pnm image and converts it into a ddif image file. pnmtoddif writes pbm format (bitmap) data as a 1 bit ddif, pgm format data (grayscale) as an 8 bit grayscale ddif, and ppm format (color) data as an 8,8,8 bit color ddif. pnmtoddif writes any ddif image file uncompressed. the data plane organization is interleaved by pixel. in addition to the number of pixels in the width and height dimension, ddif
pnmtofiasco	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtofiasco compresses the named pbm, pgm, or ppm image files, or standard input if no file is named, and produces a fiasco file on standard output.output. 
pnmtofits	this program is part of netpbm(1). in netpbm 10.30 (october 2005), pnmtofits was extended and renamed to pamtofits(1). pamtofits is backward compatible with pnmtofits.pamtofits is backward compatible with pnmtofits. 
pnmtojbig	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtojbig reads a pbm or pgm image, compresses it, and outputs the image as a jbig bi-level image entity (bie) file. jbig is a highly effective lossless compression algorithm for bi-level images (one bit per pixel), which is particularly suitable for scanned document pages. a jbig encoded image can be stored in several resolutions (progressive mode). these resolution layers can be stored all in one single bie or they can be stored in several
pnmtojpeg	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtojpeg converts the named pbm, pgm, or ppm image file, or the standard input if no file is named, to a jfif file on the standard output. pnmtojpeg uses the independent jpeg group's jpeg library to create the output file. see http://www.ijg.org for information on the library. 'jfif' is the correct name for the image format commonly known as 'jpeg.' strictly speaking, jpeg is a method of compression. the image format using jpeg compression
pnmtopalm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtopalm reads a pnm image as input, from standard input or pnmfile and produces a palm bitmap as output. palm bitmap files are either grayscale files 1, 2, or 4 bits wide, or color files 8 bits wide, so pnmtopalm automatically scales colors to have an appropriate maxval, unless you specify a depth or max depth. input files must have an appropriate number and set of colors for the selected output constraints. this often
pnmtopclxl	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtopclxl reads one or more pnm input streams, each containing one or more pnm images, and generates a sequence of output pages in the hp pcl-xl (formerly named pcl 6) printer control language. you can send this stream to a pcl-xl printer to print the images. if the input is ppm, the output is a color printer stream (the pcl color space is rgb). otherwise, the output is grayscale (the pcl color space is
pnmtoplainpnm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtoplainpnm was obsoleted in netpbm 10.23 (july 2004) by pnmtopnm(1).justusethenetpbmcommonoption -plain. pnmtoplainpnm exists today for backward compatibility; all it does is call pnmtopnm -plain. pnmtoplainpnm was new in netpbm 8.2 (march 2000) as a renaming of pnmnoraw, which was new in pbmplus in november 1989.pnmtoplainpnm was new in netpbm 8.2 (march 2000) as a renaming of pnmnoraw, which was new in pbmplus in november 1989. 
pnmtopng	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtopng reads a pnm image as input and produces a png image as output. color component values in png files are either eight or sixteen bits wide, so pnmtopng will automatically scale colors to have a maxval of 255 or 65535. for a grayscale image, pnmtopng produces a png bit depth 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. when the input image has a small maxval, the output png image has a correspondingly small bit
pnmtopnm	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtopnm simply copies a pnm image to standard output. the output has the same major pnm format (pbm, pgm, or ppm) and maxval as the input. this may seem an unnecessary duplication of cat, but it lets you convert between the plain (ascii) and raw (binary) subformats of pnm. use the -plain netpbm common option to ensure the output is plain pnm, and don't use -plain to ensure the output is raw pnm. see
pnmtops	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtops reads a netpbm image stream as input and produces encapsulated postscript (epsf) as output. if the input file is in color (ppm), pnmtops generates a color postscript file. some postscript interpreters can't handle color postscript. if you have one of these you will need to run your image through ppmtopgm first. if you specify no output dimensioning options, the output image is dimensioned as if you had specified -scale=1.0, which means aproximately 72
pnmtorast	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtorastreads a ppm image as input and produces a sun rasterfile as output. color values in sun rasterfiles are eight bits wide, so pnmtorast will automatically scale colors to have a maxval of 255. an extra pamdepth step is not necessary.step is not necessary. 
pnmtorle	this program is part of netpbm(1). this program converts netpbm image files into utah rle image files. you can include an alpha mask. if the input is a multiple image file, the output consists of several concatenated rle images. the rle file will contain either a three channel color image (24 bits) or a single channel grayscale image (8 bits) depending upon the pnm file depth. if a converted ppm is displayed on an 8 bit display, the image must
pnmtosgi	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtosgi reads a pnm image as input and produces an sgi image file as output. the sgi image will be 2-dimensional (1 channel) for pbm and pgm input, and 3-dimensional (3 channels) for ppm.and 3-dimensional (3 channels) for ppm. 
pnmtosir	this program is part of netpbm(1). pnmtosir reads a pnm image as input and produces a solitaire image recorder format image. pnmtosir produces an mgi type 17 file for pbm and pgm files. for ppm, it writes a mgi type 11 file.pnmtosir produces an mgi type 17 file for pbm and pgm files. for ppm, it writes a mgi type 11 file.

powerpc64-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
powerpc64-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
powerpc64-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
powerpc64-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
powerpc64-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
powerpc64-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in

powerpc64-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
powerpc64-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
powerpc64-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
powerpc64-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
powerpc64-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

powerpc64-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
powerpc64-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
powerpc64-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
powerpc64-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
powerpc64-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
powerpc64-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
powerpc64-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

ppm2nokia	ppm2nokia is a simple script distributed within gnokii package that converts images in ppm and pgm files to the format that can be saved to the nokia phone as operator or start up logo. both nol (operator logo) and ngg (startup logo) formats are supported. input file is read from stdin and output is written to stdout. ppm2nokia determines which format to choose by checking the image size. 78x21 format determines nol and 72x14 -- ngg. use -i option to
ppm2tiff	ppm2tiff converts a file in the ppm, pgm and pbm image formats to tiff. by default, the tiff image is created with data samples packed (planarconfiguration=1), compressed with the packbits algorithm (compression=32773), and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes. these characteristics can be overridden, or explicitly specified with the options described below if the ppm file contains greyscale data, then the photometricinterpretation tag is set to 1 (min-is-black), otherwise it is set to 2 (rgb). if no ppm
ppm3d	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppm3d reads two ppm images as input and produces a ppm as output, with the images overlapping by the specified number of pixels in blue-green/red format. the idea is that if you look at the image with 3-d glasses (glasses that admit only red through one eye and only green or blue through the other), you see an image with depth. this is called an anaglyph stereogram. ppm3d can produce either of two kinds
ppmbrighten	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmbrighten increases or decreases the saturation and value (from the hsv color space) of each pixel of a ppm image. you specify the per centage change for each of those parameters. you can also remap the colors of the pixels so their values cover the full range of possible values. hue-saturation-value, or hsv, is one way to represent a color, like the more well-known rgb. hue, saturation, and value are numbers in the range
ppmchange	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmchange reads a ppm image as input and changes all pixels of colr oldcolor to color newcolor. you may specify up to 256 oldcolor/newcolor pairs on the command line. ppmchange leaves all colors not mentioned unchanged, unless you specify the -remainder option, in which case they are all changed to the single specified color. you can specify that colors similar, but not identical, to the ones you specify get replaced by specifying a 'closeness'
ppmcie	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmcie creates a ppm file containing a plot of the cie 'tongue' color chart -- to the extent possible in a ppm image. alternatively, creates a pseudo-ppm image of the color tongue using rgb values from a color system of your choice. the cie color tongue is an image of all the hues that can be described by cie x-y chromaticity coordinates. they are arranged on a two dimensional coordinate plane with the x
ppmcolormask	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmcolormask reads a ppm file as input and produces a pbm (bitmap) file as output. the output file is the same dimensions as the input file and is black in all places where the input file is a color indicated by the -color option, and white everywhere else. the output of ppmcolormask is useful as an alpha mask input to pamcomp. note that you can generate such an alpha mask automatically as you convert
ppmcolors	ppmcolors is obsolete. the more general program pamseq(1)tookitsplaceinjune2002. ppmcolors remains for backward compatibility, but all it does is run pamseq. it is slower and less flexible than running pamseq directly.directly. 
ppmdcfont	this program is part of netpbm(1). (there are no arguments or options) ppmdcfont creates a c source file that you can compile into a built-in font for use with the netpbm ppm drawing facilities. it reads a ppmdfont file on standard input and writes the c source code to standard output. the output c source code has the font object's name hardcoded as ppmd_standardfont, which you will definitely want to edit, because that is the name of the font built
ppmddumpfont	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmddumpfont reads a ppmdfont file on standard input and writes to standard error a human readable description of the font. (there are no arguments or options) see libnetpbmppmdrawingfunction manual (1) for details on ppmdfont files.see libnetpbmppmdrawingfunction manual (1) for details on ppmdfont files.

ppmdist	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmdist reads a ppm image as input and performs a simplistic grayscale assignment intended for use with grayscale or bitmap printers. often conversion from ppm to pgm will yield an image with contrast too low for good printer output. the program maximizes contrast between the gray levels output. a ppm input of n colors is read, and a pgm of n gray levels is written. the gray levels take on the values 0..n-1, while
ppmdither	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmdither reads a ppm image as input, and applies dithering to it to reduce the number of colors used down to the specified number of shades for each primary. the default number of shades is red=5, green=9, blue=5, for a total of 225 colors. to convert the image to a binary rgb format suitable for color printers, use -red 2 -green 2 -blue 2. you can do another kind of dither -- floyd-steinberg --
ppmdmkfont	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmdmkfont creates the 'standard' ppmdfont font as a ppmdfont file. it has no input; it always generates identical files. (there are no arguments or options) this program is useful mainly as an example for creating other fonts. libnetpbm has the 'stanard' font built in. see libnetpbmppmdrawingfunction manual (1) for details on ppmdfont files.see libnetpbmppmdrawingfunction manual (1) for details on ppmdfont files. 
ppmdraw	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmdraw draws lines, shapes, text, etc. on a ppm image. it is essentially an easy-to-program front end to libnetpbm's 'ppmd' subroutines. it lets you create a human-friendly script to describe the drawing rather than write a c program. you supply drawing instructions with a script, which you supply either in a file named by a -scriptfile option or as the value of a -script option. here is an example script: setpos 50 50; text_here
ppmfade	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmfadegenerates a transition between either two input images or between one input image and black. you can use the 30 intermediate images generated to show a smooth transition between segments of a movie. the input and output images are in the ppm format. if you specify both input images, they should both be the same size. if you want to fade from black to an image, specify only the last image. if you want
ppmflash	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmflash reads a ppm image as input. it changes the color of each pixel to bring it a specified amount closer to white. it generates a ppm image of the result. flashfactor is a real number between 0 and 1, inclusive. ppmflash increases the intensity of each rgb component by the fraction flashfactor of the difference between the current value and full intensity. so if a pixel contains 60% full red, 10% full green,
ppmforge	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmforge generates three kinds of ''random fractal forgeries,'' the term coined by richard f. voss of the ibm thomas j. watson research center for seemingly realistic pictures of natural objects generated by simple algorithms embodying randomness and fractal self-similarity. the techniques used by ppmforge are essentially those given by voss[1], particularly the technique of spectral synthesis explained in more detail by dietmar saupe[2]. the program generates two varieties of pictures: planets and clouds, which

ppmmix	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmmix reads two ppm images as input and mixes them together using the specified fade factor. the fade factor may be in the range from 0.0 (only ppmfile1's image data) to 1.0 (only ppmfile2's image data). anything in between specifies a smooth blend between the two images. the two images must have the same dimensions. pamcomp is a more general alternative. it allows you to mix images of different size and to have the
ppmnorm	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmnorm was replaced in netpbm 9.25 (march 2002) by pnmnorm(1). pnmnorm is backward compatible with ppmnorm except that for pbm and pgm input, it produced pbm and pgm output.pnmnorm is backward compatible with ppmnorm except that for pbm and pgm input, it produced pbm and pgm output. 
ppmntsc	this program is part of netpbm(1). this program makes colors legal in the ntsc (or pal) color systems. often, images generated on the computer are made for use in movies which ultimately end up on a television screen. however, the range of colors (as specified by their rgb values) on a computer does not match the range of colors that can be represented using the ntsc (or pal) systems. if an image with 'illegal' colors is sent directly to an
ppmpat	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmpat produces a ppm of the specified width and height, with a pattern in it. this program is mainly to demonstrate use of the ppmdraw routines, a simple but powerful drawing library. see the ppmdraw.h include file for more info on using these routines. still, some of the patterns can be rather pretty. if you have a color workstation, something like ppmpat -squig 300 300 | pnmquant 128 should generate a nice background. some
ppmquant	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmquant is obsolete. all it does now is invoke pnmquant or pnmremap. you should use one of those programs in any new program, or if you are modifying an old program, and your program does not have to work with a version of netpbm before 9.21 (january 2001). ppmquant exists only for name compatibility. pnmquant is fully backward compatible with ppmquant without the -mapfile option; pnmremap is fully backward compatible with ppmquant with the
ppmquantall	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmquantall takes a bunch of ppm images as input, chooses ncolors colors to best represent all of the images, maps the existing colors to the new ones, and overwrites the input files with the new quantized versions. if you don't want to overwrite your input files, use the -ext option. the output files are then named the same as the input files, plus a period and the extension text you specify. verbose explanation: let's
ppmrainbow	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmrainbow generates a ppm image that fades from one color to another to another from left to right, like a rainbow. the colors are those you specify on the command line, in that order. the first color is added again on the right end of the image unless you specify the -norepeat option. if you want a vertical or other non-horizontal rainbow, run the output through pnmrotate or pamflip. one use for such a
ppmrelief	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmrelief reads a ppm image as input, does a laplacian relief filter, and writes a ppm image as output. the laplacian relief filter is described in 'beyond photography' by holzmann, equation 3.19. it's a sort of edge-detection.the laplacian relief filter is described in 'beyond photography' by holzmann, equation 3.19. it's a sort of edge-detection. 
ppmrough	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmrough generates a ppm image of the specified width, height, and colors. ppmrough tiles the image into semi-rectangular regions with a ragged borders between them. it calculates the fluctuations with the rand() standard c library function. ppmrough writes the ppm image to standard output. the maxval of the output image is 255 (you can change this with pamdepth). use the options -left or -right, respectively, to make vertical borders, and -top or -bottom, respectively,
ppmshadow	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmshadow adds a simulated shadow to an image, giving the appearance that the contents of the image float above the page, casting a diffuse shadow on the background. shadows can either be black, as cast by opaque objects, or translucent, where the shadow takes on the color of the object which casts it. you can specify the crispness of the shadow and its displacement from the image with command line options. ppmshadow sees your
ppmshift	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmshift reads a ppm image as input. shifts every row of image data to the left or right by a random amount, within a range of shift pixels. the random distribution is uniform, centered at zero movement. the randomness in the image is limited before netpbm 10.37 (december 2006) -- if you run the program twice in the same second, you may get identical output. this is another one of those effects i intended
ppmspread	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmspread reads a ppm image as input and moves every pixel around a random bit relative to its original position. amount determines by how many pixels a pixel is to be moved around at most. pictures processed with this filter will seem to be somewhat dissolved or unfocussed (although they appear more coarse than images processed by something like pnmconvol). the randomness in the image is limited before netpbm 10.37 (december 2006) -- if
ppmtoacad	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtoacad reads a ppm image as input and produces an autocad® slide file or binary database import (.dxb) file as output. if you don't specify ppmfile, ppmtoacad takes the input from standard input.

ppmtopgm	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtopgm reads a ppm as input and produces a pgm as output. the output is a 'black and white' rendering of the original image, as in a black and white photograph. the quantization formula ppmtopgm uses is g = .299 r + .587 g + .114 b. note that although there is a pgmtoppm program, it is not necessary for simple conversions from pgm to ppm , because any ppm program can read pgm
ppmtopi1	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtopi1 reads a ppm image as input and produces an atari degas .pi1 file as output.ppmtopi1 reads a ppm image as input and produces an atari degas .pi1 file as output. 
ppmtopict	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtopict reads a ppm image as input and produces a macintosh pict file as output. the generated file is only the data fork of a picture. you will need a program such as mcvert to generate a macbinary or a binhex file that contains the necessary information to identify the file as a pict file to macos. even though pict can have 2 and 4 bits per pixel, ppmtopict always generates an 8 bits
ppmtopj	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtopj reads a ppm image as input and converts it into a format suitable to be printed by an hp paintjet printer. for best results, the input file should be in 8-color rgb form; i.e. it should have only the 8 binary combinations of full-on and full-off primaries. you could convert your input to this format like this: pamseq 3 1 testimg.ppm >8color.pam pnmremap -map 8color.pam testimg.pam | ppmtopjor you could use use ppmdither
ppmtopjxl	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtopjxl reads a ppm image as input and produces a pcl file suitable for printing on an hp paintjet xl printer as output. the generated file is not suitable for printing on a normal printjet printer. the -nopack option generates a file which does not use the normal tiff 4.0 compression method. this file might be printable on a normal paintjet printer (not an xl). the -gamma option sets the gamma correction for the
ppmtoppm	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtoppm simply copies a ppm image from standard input to standard output. this may seem an unnecessary duplication of cat, but remember that a ppm program can read a pbm or pgm image, and the right kind of pam, as if it were ppm. so ppmtoppm can read either a pbm, pgm, or ppm image and produce a ppm image as output. even that is of limited usefulness because of the fact that almost
ppmtopuzz	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtopuzz reads a ppm image as input and produces an x11 'puzzle' file as output. a 'puzzle' file is for use with the puzzle program included with the x11 distribution. puzzle's -picture option lets you specify an image file.with the x11 distribution. puzzle's -picture option lets you specify an image file. 
ppmtorgb3	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtorgb3 reads a ppm image as input and writes three pgm images as output, one each for red, green, and blue. ppmtorgb3 constructs the output filenames by taking the input filename, stripping off any extension, and appending .red, .grn, .blu. for example, separating lenna.ppm would result in lenna.red, lenna.grn, and lenna.blu. if the input comes from stdin, the names are noname.red, noname.grn, and noname.blu.the names are noname.red, noname.grn, and noname.blu. 
ppmtosixel	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtosixel reads a ppm image as input and produces sixel commands (six) as output. the output is formatted for color printing, e.g. for a dec lj250 color inkjet printer. if rgb values from the ppm file do not have maxval=100, ppmtosixel rescales them to maxval 100. a printer control header and a color assignment table begin the six file. image data is in a compressed format by default. a printer control footer ends the
ppmtoterm	this program is part of netpbm(1). this program tries to produce an accurate representation of a ppm image on an terminal that implements the ansi iso 6429 standard. it aproximates colors, finding the minimum cartesian distance between the input rgb vectors and the ones in the generated palette. as the available color palette is somewhat restricted, you get the best results when the colors in the original image are few and the rgb intensities are close to zero, half of

ppmtowinicon	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtowinicon reads one or more ppm images as input and produces a microsoft windows .ico file as output. a windows icon contains 1 or more images, at different resolutions and color depths. when windows wants to display the icon, it searches through the images to find the one the best matches the number of colors and resolution of the display. microsoft recommends including at least the following formats in each icon.microsoft recommends including at
ppmtoxpm	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtoxpm reads a ppm image as input and produces x11 pixmap (version 3) as output. this format can be loaded by the xpm library. in the xpm output, colors may be identified by name, such as "red", or in hexadecimal, for example "#ff0000". in the hexadecimal format, there may be from 1 through 4 hexadecimal digits per rgb component. by default, ppmtoxpbm tries to find a name for each color in the image in
ppmtoy4m	ppmtoy4m converts one or more raw ppm images into a yuv4mpeg2 stream ready for further processing by other video tools. output is to stdout to facilitate piping to other mjpeg tools. the size of the output frame(s) is determined from the (first) input image. input is a 'raw' format ppm image, read from stdin or from the optional filename. the input may contain multiple ppm images concatenated together; ppmtoy4m will read and process them sequentially. all images must have identical
ppmtoyuv	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtoyuv reads a ppm image as input and produces an abekas yuv file as output. the output file contains a raster of four byte yuv codes, each uniquely associated with two side-by-side pixels in the image. the raster contains rows in order from top to bottom, and within each row columns from left to right. so the output file size in bytes is twice the number of pixels in the image. each yuv code
ppmtoyuvsplit	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtoyuvsplit reads a ppm image as input. produces 3 raw files basename.y, basename.u and basename.v as output. the output files are the subsampled raw yuv representation of the input ppm image, as required by the stanford mpeg codec. the y output file contains a byte for each pixel in the image, with the rows going from top to bottom and the columns within each row going left to right. the u and v output
ppmtv	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmtv reads a ppm image as input and dims every other row of image data down by the specified dim factor. this factor may be in the range of 0.0 (the alternate lines are totally black) to 1.0 (original image). this creates an effect similar to what i've once seen in the video clip 'you could be mine' by guns'n'roses. in the scene i'm talking about you can see john connor on his motorbike,
ppmwheel	this program is part of netpbm(1). ppmwheel produces a ppm image of a color wheel of the specified diameter inside a white square just large enough to hold it. the color wheel is based on the hsv color model. hues are distributed angularly around the circle and the values are distributed radially and the saturation is zero everywhere. the values are zero at the center, increasing linearly to maximum at the edge. the maximum value corresponds to the maxval of
pport	the program pport is a simple yet handy program and its documented counterpart for accessing the output pins of multiple ports. using this bundle, one can successfully control any household appliance or electronic device with minimal hassle and practically no changes. pport will alter the state (toggle or set) of the data pins specified by the user, of the parallel port or other supported ports using flippers to toggle or set, modifiers to alter the methods and provides information all
pportd	pportd is the counterpart of the pport program. it reads the input pins of the parallel port and executes commands based on a configuration file called pportd.conf that is meant to reside in the sysconfdir of the system. pportd will read a configuration file, calibrate your parallel port to its internal functions and then depending on your flags, will fork into the background or stay in the foreground, being either verbose or silent, executing commands. pportd will read the input

rdsinit	rdsinit is a utility that constructs an initialized rds heap in an rvm segment. it is intended to create a structure that can be loaded by rds_load_heap. there are three different ways of using rdsinit. general users are expected to use first two interactive modes, where users may supply parameters for the rds heap interactively or on command line arguments. however, in both cases, users will be asked interactively to confirm their choice of parameters before rdsinit goes ahead to
rdup	rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing backups. rdup itself does not backup anything. it only prints a list of files that are changed, or all files in case of a null dump. it also handles files that are removed, allowing for correct incremental backups. all paths printed are absolute. rdup uses the change time (ctime) to decide whether a file is altered. it works as follows, for a full dump .. crawl all
rdup-cp	rdup-cp copies the files it gets from standard input to the directory dest. this script can be used to restore files from a backup, especially when the -a option of rdup is used. the command line would look something like this: rdup /dev/null from | rdup-cp dest or when you need rdup to fill in the extended attributes: rdup -a /dev/null from | rdup-cp dest dest can only be a local directory.dest can only be a local directory. 
rdup-crypt	rdup-crypt, by default, encrypts the data it receives from rdup with the key contained in keyfile. the default algorithm used is blowfish for example, rdup -c list ~/documents | rdup-crypt key | rdup-snap -c -b /tmp/storagenote the -c option for rdup-snap. also note that you cannot change the output format of rdup-crypt. the format used is rdup's default.rdup -c list ~/documents | rdup-crypt key | rdup-snap -c -b /tmp/storagenote the -c option for rdup-snap. also note that you cannot change
rdup-gpg	rdup-gpg, by default, encrypts the data it receives from rdup with the default public key in your key ring. when recipient is empty, the default recipient (you) is used, otherwise it is used in the --default-recipient option of 'gpg'. for example, rdup -c list ~/documents | rdup-gpg | rdup-snap -c -b /tmp/storagenote the -c option for rdup-snap.rdup -c list ~/documents | rdup-gpg | rdup-snap -c -b /tmp/storagenote the -c option for rdup-snap.

rdup-purge	rdup-purge deletes old backup directories. it does this in a logorithmic way (idea taken from simple-backup). it will delete in the following way: the last 30 days - keep everything last 100 days, keep a backup every 7 days, delete the rest last 1000 days, keep a backup every 100 days, delete the rest more than a 1000 days - delete everything.more than a 1000 days - delete everything. 
rdup-restore	rdup-restore is a frontend to 'rdup-snap -r' and 'rdup'. it will restore everything from sources to directory. source can be a remote location (use the ssh:// syntax), if you use that syntax only one source can be used. when using this syntax the files are pulled from the remote server using 'ssh'. there is no provisioning for ssh so unless you have configured ssh to work without a passphrase you will be asked to supply one. also note that the
rdup-simple	rdup-simple is a front end for 'rdup-snap' and 'rdup'. it will backup all directories and files given on the command line. it will create a hard linked backup directory structure under the specified directory. with the optional +days argument you can specify how far backup rdup-simple looks back for previous backups. this should be a number in the range 1..99. it defaults to 8 days. rdup-simple will create the directory '~/.rdup' and will store its administrative files there. this program
rdup-snap	rdup-snap copies the files it gets from standard input to the directory specified with the -b option. this script implements the backup policy. it works on a directory that is hard linked or on an empty directory. when the directory is empty a full dump is performed. if a file (i.e. hard link) already exists in the backup directory it will be removed. the end result will be that you will be left with a complete mirror of your directory
rdup-snap-link	rdup-snap-link creates a hard linked copy of a previous backup directory. if such a directory is created rdup-snap-link exists with 0. if a full dump should be performed a 1 is returned. if 2 is returned an error has occured. gnu cp is used for the actual creation of the copy. on non gnu operating systems you may need to install gnu cp. this utility is called from rdup-simple. the -h option makes rdup-snap-link understand hourly backups. it will then
rdup-tr	transform rdup output into something else. where something else can be a tar, cpio, pax archive or another rdup stream. the rdup archive must be given on rdup-tr's standard input. you can select multiple types of output (-o flag), but you must be aware that you may loose some information in formats other than rdup's own, see the table below. you may also supply rdup-tr with only a list of pathnames, this can be selected with the -l flag. the

runuser	change the effective user id and group id to that of user. only session pam hooks are run, and there is no password prompt. this command is useful only when run as the root user. if run as a non-root user without privilege to set user id, the command will fail as the binary is not setuid. as runuser doesn't run auth and account pam hooks, it runs with lower overhead than su.auth and account pam hooks, it runs with
runx	if xfree86 corrupts your textmode font, try putting restorefont(1) in your path and use the shell script runx to run x. runx saves the vga font data in /tmp/fontdata, and restores it when you exit x. the runx script actually is: #!/bin/sh echo saving font in /tmp/fontdata restorefont -w /tmp/fontdata startx echo restoring font from /tmp/fontdata restorefont -r /tmp/fontdata note that this doesn't help with syncing problems. a more rigorous alternative is to run the savetextmode(1) script before running x,
rup	rup displays a summary of the current system status of a particular host or all hosts on the local network. the output shows the current time of day, how long the system has been up, and the load averages. the load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes. the following options are available: -d'        for each host, report what its local time
ruptime	ruptime gives a status line like uptime for each machine on the local network; these are formed from packets broadcast by each host on the network once a minute. machines for which no status report has been received for 11 minutes are shown as being down. options: -a'        users idle an hour or more are not counted unless the -a flagis given. -l' sort by load average. -r' reverses the sort order. -t'
rusers	the rusers command produces output similar to who, but for the list of hosts or all machines on the local network. for each host responding to the rusers query, the hostname with the names of the users currently logged on is printed on each line. the rusers command will wait for one minute to catch late responders. the following options are available: -a'        print all machines responding even if no one is currentlylogged
rvi	vim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. it can be used to edit all kinds of plain text. it is especially useful for editing programs. there are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc.. see ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between vim and vi. while running vim a lot of help can be obtained from

s390x-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
s390x-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
s390x-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
s390x-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in

s390x-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
s390x-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
s390x-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
s390x-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
s390x-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
s390x-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
s390x-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

sa-compile	sa-compile uses "re2c" to compile the site-wide parts of the spamassassin ruleset. no part of user_prefs or any files included from user_prefs can be built into the compiled set. this compiled set is then used by the "mail::spamassassin::plugin::rule2xsbody" plugin to speed up spamassassin's operation, where possible, and when that plugin is loaded. "re2c" can match strings much faster than perl code, by constructing a dfa to match many simple strings in parallel, and compiling that to native object code. not
sa-learn	given a typical selection of your incoming mail classified as spam or ham (non-spam), this tool will feed each mail to spamassassin, allowing it to 'learn' what signs are likely to mean spam, and which are likely to mean ham. simply run this command once for each of your mail folders, and it will ''learn'' from the mail therein. note that csh-style globbing in the mail folder names is supported; in other words, listing a folder name as "*" will
sa-update	sa-update automates the process of downloading and installing new rules and configuration, based on channels. the default channel is updates.spamassassin.org, which has updated rules since the previous release. update archives are verified using sha1 hashes and gpg signatures, by default. note that "sa-update" will not restart "spamd" or otherwise cause a scanner to reload the now-updated ruleset automatically. instead, "sa-update" is typically used in something like the following manner: sa-update && /etc/init.d/spamassassin reloadthis works because "sa-update" only returns an exit
sabcmd	sabcmd is a command line interface to sablotron xslt processor. you can use is to transform xml files with xslt stylesheets. the only required parameter is a stylesheet; this is a uri of an xslt stylesheet to be used for the transformation process. if you omit an input file, the standard input is used. in addition, you can specify an output file. if no output file is given, the output is sent to the standard output. sabcmd can also run
sadf	the sadf command is used for displaying the contents of data files created by the sar(1) command. but unlike sar, sadf can write its data in many different formats (csv, xml, etc.) the default format is one that can easily be handled by pattern processing commands like awk (see option -p). the sadf command extracts and writes to standard output records saved in the datafile file. this file must have been created by a version of sar which is compatible
safe_mysqld	mysqld_safe is the recommended way to start a mysqld server on unix and netware. mysqld_safe adds some safety features such as restarting the server when an error occurs and logging runtime information to an error log file. descriptions of error logging and netware-specific behaviors are given later in this section.are given later in this section.

sfdp	dot draws directed graphs. it works well on dags and other graphs that can be drawn as hierarchies. it reads attributed graph files and writes drawings. by default, the output format dot is the input file with layout coordinates appended. neato draws undirected graphs using ''spring'' models (see kamada and kawai, information processing letters 31:1, april 1989). input files must be formatted in the dot attributed graph language. by default, the output of neato is the input graph with layout
sff2g3	reads a common isdn api (capi) structured file format (sff) input file, and converts every fax page contained in it to a raw g3 fax file. the input sff files typically come from fax reception programs using capi on active isdn cards (isdn4linux, avm or diva cards) or similar. the output g3 files are in the ''native'' format that all other g3 utilites in the mgetty+sendfax package use. if the input file name is ''-'', sff2g3 will read from stdin.
sfparse	this tool has two different functions. when invoked with just a filename as argument, it checks that a file is a valid strings-file, which basically amounts to seeing whether the file is in proper serialized nsdictionary format (type "defaults plist" for info on this). on the other hand, if one of the two options is given, no such checking is performed, but the file is converted into the named encoding.on the other hand, if one of the two options is
sftp	sftp is an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp(1), which performs all operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport. it may also use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compression. sftp connects and logs into the specified host, then enters an interactive command mode. the second usage format will retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after successful interactive authentication. the third usage format allows sftp to start
sg	the sg command works similar to newgrp but accepts a command. the command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. with most shells you may run sg from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes. another difference between newgrp and sg is that some shells treat newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell that newgrp creates. this doesn't happen with sg, so upon exit from a sg command you are returned to your previous group
sge_ckpt	sun grid engine supports two levels of checkpointing: the user level and a operating system provided transparent level. user level checkpointing refers to applications, which do their own checkpointing by writing restart files at certain times or algorithmic steps and by properly processing these restart files when restarted. transparent checkpointing has to be provided by the operating system and is usually integrated in the operating system kernel. an example for a kernel integrated checkpointing facility is the hibernator package from

sh-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
sh-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
sh-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
sh-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
sh-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
sh-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
sh-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
sh-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
sh-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
sh-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
sh-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and

sh-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
sh-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
sh-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
sh-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
sh-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
sh-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
sh-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names. 
sh-linux-gnu-windmc	windmc reads message definitions from an input file (.mc) and translate them into a set of output files. the output files may be of four kinds:kinds:

sh64-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
sh64-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
sh64-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
sh64-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
sh64-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
sh64-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
sh64-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
sh64-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
sh64-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
sh64-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
sh64-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
sh64-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

sh64-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
sh64-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
sh64-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
sh64-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in

spamassassin	spamassassin is an intelligent email filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited bulk email, more commonly known as "spam". these tests are applied to email headers and content to classify email using advanced statistical methods. in addition, spamassassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy integration into virtually any email system.allows other technologies to be quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy
spamassassin-run	spamassassin is a simple front-end filter for spamassassin. using the spamassassin rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers and body text to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited bulk email. once identified, the mail is then tagged as spam for later filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application. the default tagging operations that take place are detailed in " tagging ". by default, message(s) are read in from stdin (< mailmessage), or from
spamc	spamc is the client half of the spamc/spamd pair. it should be used in place of "spamassassin" in scripts to process mail. it will read the mail from stdin , and spool it to its connection to spamd, then read the result back and print it to stdout . spamc has extremely low overhead in loading, so it should be much faster to load than the whole spamassassin program. see the readme file in the spamd directory of the spamassassin
spamd	the purpose of this program is to provide a daemonized version of the spamassassin executable. the goal is improving throughput performance for automated mail checking. this is intended to be used alongside "spamc", a fast, low-overhead c client program. see the readme file in the "spamd" directory of the spamassassin distribution for more details. note: although "spamd" will check per-user config files for every message, any changes to the system-wide config files will require either restarting spamd or forcing it
sparc64-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
sparc64-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
sparc64-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
sparc64-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
sparc64-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
sparc64-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
sparc64-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
sparc64-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
sparc64-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
sparc64-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
sparc64-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and

sparc64-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
sparc64-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
sparc64-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
sparc64-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in

swift-container-server	the container server's primary job is to handle listings of objects. it doesn't know where those objects are, just what objects are in a specific container. the listings are stored as sqlite database files, and replicated across the cluster similar to how objects are. statistics are also tracked that include the total number of objects, and total storage usage for that container.total number of objects, and total storage usage for that container. 
swift-container-sync	swift has a feature where all the contents of a container can be mirrored to another container through background synchronization. swift cluster operators configure their cluster to allow/accept sync requests to/from other clusters, and the user specifies where to sync their container to along with a secret synchronization key. the swift-container-sync does the job of sending updates to the remote container. this is done by scanning the local devices for container databases and checking for x-container-sync-to and x-container-sync-key metadata values.
swift-container-updater	the container updater is responsible for updating container information in the account database. it will walk the container path in the system looking for container dbs and sending updates to the account server as needed as it goes along. there are times when account data can not be immediately updated. this usually occurs during failure scenarios or periods of high load. this is where an eventual consistency window will most likely come in to play. in practice, the consistency window
swift-dispersion-populate	this is one of the swift-dispersion utilities that is used to evaluate the overall cluster health. this is accomplished by checking if a set of deliberately distributed containers and objects are currently in their proper places within the cluster. for instance, a common deployment has three replicas of each object. the health of that object can be measured by checking if each replica is in its proper place. if only 2 of the 3 is in place the object's health

swift-object-expirer	the swift-object-expirer offers scheduled deletion of objects. the swift client would use the x-delete-at or x-delete-after headers during an object put or post and the cluster would automatically quit serving that object at the specified time and would shortly thereafter remove the object from the system. the x-delete-at header takes a unix epoch timestamp, in integer form; for example: 1317070737 represents mon sep 26 20:58:57 2011 utc. the x-delete-after header takes a integer number of seconds. the proxy server that
swift-object-info	this is a very simple swift tool that allows a swiftop engineer to retrieve information about an object that is located on the storage node. one calls the tool with a given object file as it is stored on the storage node system. it will then return several information about that object such as;tool with a given object file as it is stored on the storage node system. it will then return several information about that object such as; 
swift-object-replicator	replication is designed to keep the system in a consistent state in the face of temporary error conditions like network outages or drive failures. the replication processes compare local data with each remote copy to ensure they all contain the latest version. object replication uses a hash list to quickly compare subsections of each partition. replication updates are push based. for object replication, updating is just a matter of rsyncing files to the peer. the replicator also ensures that data
swift-object-server	the object server is a very simple blob storage server that can store, retrieve and delete objects stored on local devices. objects are stored as binary files on the filesystem with metadata stored in the file's extended attributes (xattrs). this requires that the underlying filesystem choice for object servers support xattrs on files. some filesystems, like ext3, have xattrs turned off by default. each object is stored using a path derived from the object name's hash and the operation's timestamp.
swift-object-updater	the object updater is responsible for updating object information in container listings. it will check to see if there are any locally queued updates on the filesystem of each devices, what is also known as async pending file(s), walk each one and update the container listing. for example, suppose a container server is under load and a new object is put into the system. the object will be immediately available for reads as soon as the proxy server responds to

tcpbridge	this manual page briefly documents the tcpbridge command. the basic operation of tcpbridge is to be a network bridge between two subnets. all packets received on one interface are sent via the other. optionally, packets can be edited in a variety of ways according to your needs. for more details, please see the tcpreplay manual at: http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac/wiki/manualfor more details, please see the tcpreplay manual at: http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac/wiki/manual 
tcpbug	tcpbug forwards a tcp/ip connection to port local-port on the local machine to the port remote-port on remote-host while spying on the connection and writing all data passing through to standard output. all data coming from the client is printed with a greater than sign (>) first on each line, and all data coming from the server is printed with a less than sign (<) first on each line. any byte offsets and time-stamps are printed before the greater than
tcpconnect	tcpconnect creates a tcp/ip connection to a server running on the machine host, listening to port port. it then reads standard input and sends to the remote server, and data received from the server is printed to standard output. when end-of-file is reached on both standard input and the tcp/ip connection, tcpconnect terminates.tcp/ip connection, tcpconnect terminates. 
tcpflow	tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of tcp connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis or debugging. a program like tcpdump(4) shows a summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's actually being transmitted. in contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow understands tcp sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct
tcplisten	tcplisten waits for a tcp/ip connection on port. if a localaddr parameter is given, tcplisten will bind to that ip address. otherwise tcplisten will accept connections to any of the local machines ip addresses. data received from the client is printed on standard output, and data read from standard input is sent to the client. when end-of-file is reached on both standard input and the tcp/ip connection, tcplisten terminates.terminates. 
tcpprep	this manual page briefly documents the tcpprep command. the basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend all packets from the input file(s) out a single file. tcpprep processes a pcap file and applies a set of user-specified rules to create a cache file which tells tcpreplay wether or not to send each packet and which interface the packet should be sent out of. for more details, please see the tcpreplay manual at: http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac/wiki/manualfor more details, please see the tcpreplay manual

tcpshow	tcpshow reads a tcpdump(1) savefile and provides a reasonably complete decode of ethernet, ip, icmp, udp and tcp headers, in packets that match the boolean expression. the data belonging to these packets is displayed in ascii. currently, protocol data is not decoded. this is not considered a serious problem for applications that use ascii data streams. also, ip and tcp options are not decoded. the input file must be in the format produced by tcpdump -enx. this file can be
tcpstat	tcpstat reports certain network interface statistics much like vmstat(8) does for system statistics. statistics include bandwidth being used, number of packets, average packet size, and much more. network information is collected either by reading data from filename, or by directly monitoring the network interface interface. the default action for tcpstat is to automatically search for an appropriate interface, and to show current statistics on it. interval is the sample interval, in seconds, in which the statistics are based upon and
tcptool	the tcptool program transfers data from one sender to one or multiple recipients using the tcp protocol. if the program is started in sender mode it listens for incoming connection requests from recipients. after checking the ip address against a set of allowed ip address / net mask pairs (see the -a option) tcptool reads one byte from the connection. this byte contains a flag indicating ''i am the last client, start transmission now'' in the least significant bit. if
tcptrace	tcptrace takes a tcpdump file specified on the command line (or from standard input) and produces a summarization of the connections.produces a summarization of the connections. 
tcptraceroute	tcptraceroute is a traceroute implementation using tcp packets. the more traditional traceroute(8) sends out either udp or icmp echo packets with a ttl of one, and increments the ttl until the destination has been reached. by printing the gateways that generate icmp time exceeded messages along the way, it is able to determine the path packets are taking to reach the destination. the problem is that with the widespread use of firewalls on the modern internet, many of the packets
tcptrack	tcptrack displays the status of tcp connections that it sees on a given network interface. tcptrack monitors their state and displays information such as state, source/destination addresses and bandwidth usage in a sorted, updated list very much like the top(1) command. the filter expression is a standard pcap filter expression (identical to the expressions used by tcpdump(8)) which can be used to filter down the characteristics of tcp connections that tcptrack will see. see tcpdump(8) for more information about the

tiff2rgba	tiff2rgba converts a wide variety of tiff images into an rgba tiff image. this includes the ability to translate different color spaces and photometric interpretation into rgba, support for alpha blending, and translation of many different bit depths into a 32bit rgba image. internally this program is implemented using the tiffreadrgbaimage() function, and it suffers any limitations of that image. this includes limited support for > 8 bitspersample images, and flaws with some esoteric combinations of bitspersample, photometric interpretation, block
tiffcmp	tiffcmp compares the tags and data in two files created according to the tagged image file format, revision 6.0. the schemes used for compressing data in each file are immaterial when data are compared-data are compared on a scanline-by-scanline basis after decompression. most directory tags are checked; notable exceptions are: grayresponsecurve, colorresponsecurve, and colormap tags. data will not be compared if any of the bitspersample, samplesperpixel, or imagewidth values are not equal. by default, tiffcmp will terminate if it encounters
tiffcp	tiffcp combines one or more files created according to the tag image file format, revision 6.0 into a single tiff file. because the output file may be compressed using a different algorithm than the input files, tiffcp is most often used to convert between different compression schemes. by default, tiffcp will copy all the understood tags in a tiff directory of an input file to the associated directory in the output file. tiffcp can be used to reorganize the storage
tiffcrop	tiffcrop processes one or more files created according to the tag image file format, revision 6.0, specification into one or more tiff file(s). tiffcrop is most often used to extract portions of an image for processing with bar code recognizer or ocr software when that software cannot restrict the region of interest to a specific portion of the image or to improve efficiency when the regions of interest must be rotated. it can also be used to subdivide all or

tile-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
tile-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
tile-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
tile-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
tile-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
tile-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
tile-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
tile-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
tile-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
tile-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
tile-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
tile-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a

tile-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
tile-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
tile-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
tile-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
tile-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
tile-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
tile-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.

trace-cmd	the trace-cmd(1) command interacts with the ftrace tracer that is built inside the linux kernel. it interfaces with the ftrace specific files found in the debugfs file system under the tracing directory. a command must be specified to tell trace-cmd what to do.debugfs file system under the tracing directory. a command must be specified to tell trace-cmd what to do. 
trace-cmd-extract	the trace-cmd(1) extract is usually used after trace-cmd-start(1) and trace-cmd-stop(1). it can be used after the ftrace tracer has been started manually through the ftrace pseudo file system. the extract command creates a trace.dat file that can be used by trace-cmd-report(1) to read from. it reads the kernel internal ring buffer to produce the trace.dat file.produce the trace.dat file. 
trace-cmd-list	the trace-cmd(1) list displays the available plugins, events or ftrace options that are configured on the current machine. if no option is given, then it lists all plugins, events and ftrace options to standard output.lists all plugins, events and ftrace options to standard output. 
trace-cmd-listen	the trace-cmd(1) listen sets up a port to listen to waiting for connections from other hosts that run trace-cmd-record(1) with the -n option. when a connection is made, and the remote host sends data, it will create a file called trace.host:port.dat. where host is the name of the remote host, and port is the port that the remote host used to connect with.and port is the port that the remote host used to connect with. 
trace-cmd-record	the trace-cmd(1) record command will set up the ftrace linux kernel tracer to record the specified plugins or events that happen while the command executes. if no command is given, then it will record until the user hits ctrl-c. the record command of trace-cmd will set up the ftrace tracer to start tracing the various events or plugins that are given on the command line. it will then create a number of tracing processes (one per cpu) that will start
trace-cmd-report	the trace-cmd(1) report command will output a human readable report of a trace created by trace-cmd record.the trace-cmd(1) report command will output a human readable report of a trace created by trace-cmd record. 
trace-cmd-reset	the trace-cmd(1) reset command turns off all tracing of ftrace. this will bring back the performance of the system before tracing was enabled. this is necessary since trace-cmd-record(1), trace-cmd-stop(1) and trace-cmd-extract(1) do not disable the tracer, event after the data has been pulled from the buffers. the rational is that the user may want to manually enable the tracer with the ftrace pseudo file system, or examine other parts of ftrace to see what trace-cmd did. after the reset command
trace-cmd-split	the trace-cmd(1) split is used to break up a trace.dat into small files. the start-time specifies where the new file will start at. using trace-cmd-report(1) and copying the time stamp given at a particular event, can be used as input for either start-time or end-time. the split will stop creating files when it reaches an event after end-time. if only the end-time is needed, use 0.0 as the start-time. if start-time is left out, then the split will start at
trace-cmd-start	the trace-cmd(1) start enables all the ftrace tracing the same way trace-cmd-record(1) does. the difference is that it does not run threads to create a trace.dat file. this is useful just to enable ftrace and you are only interested in the trace after some event has occurred and the trace is stopped. then the trace can be read straight from the ftrace pseudo file system or can be extracted with trace-cmd-extract(1).trace can be read straight from the ftrace pseudo file
trace-cmd-stop	the trace-cmd(1) stop is a complement to trace-cmd-start(1). this will disable ftrace from writing to the ring buffer. this does not stop the overhead that the tracing may incur. only the updating of the ring buffer is disabled, the ftrace tracing may still be inducing overhead. after stopping the trace, the trace-cmd-extract(1) may strip out the data from the ring buffer and create a trace.dat file. the ftrace pseudo file system may also be examined. to disable the tracing completely
tracecc	tracecc converts sources containing special tracing instructions (*.ctr, *.cpt, *.mtr, *.jtr) to c, c ++ , objective-c and java source files (*.c, *.cpp, *.m, *.java). depending on the options the output file will or will not contain instructions to write a trace (which source code positions does a program reach, values of variables).variables).

unsingle	megatron is used to transform files from binhex, macbinary, applesingle, or netatalk style appledouble formats into macbinary or netatalk style appledouble formats. the netatalk style appledouble format is the file format used by afpd, the netatalk apple filing protocol (appleshare) server. binhex, macbinary, and applesingle are commonly used formats for transferring macintosh files between machines via email or file transfer protocols. megatron uses its name to determine what type of tranformation is being asked of it. if megatron is called
unstr	strfile reads a file containing groups of lines separated by a line containing a single percent '%' sign (or other specified delimiter character) and creates a data file which contains a header structure and a table of file offsets for each group of lines. this allows random access of the strings. the output file, if not specified on the command line, is named sourcefile.dat. the purpose of unstr is to undo the work of strfile. it prints out the strings
unwrapdiff	unwrapdiff demangles patches that have been word-wrapped, in an attempt to make them useful. the corrected diff is sent to standard output. note that you will probably need to use the -l option when applying the patch, in order to ignore any whitespace differences there may be.whitespace differences there may be. 
unxz	xz is a general-purpose data compression tool with command line syntax similar to gzip(1) and bzip2(1). the native file format is the .xz format, but also the legacy .lzma format and raw compressed streams with no container format headers are supported. xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected operation mode. if no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard input and writes the processed data to standard output. xz will refuse (display an
unzip	unzip will list, test, or extract files from a zip archive, commonly found on ms-dos systems. the default behavior (with no options) is to extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all files from the specified zip archive. a companion program, zip(1l), creates zip archives; both programs are compatible with archives created by pkware's pkzip and pkunzip for ms-dos, but in many cases the program options or default behaviors differ.behaviors differ. 
unzipsfx	unzipsfx is a modified version of unzip(1l) designed to be prepended to existing zip archives in order to form self-extracting archives. instead of taking its first non-flag argument to be the zipfile(s) to be extracted, unzipsfx seeks itself under the name by which it was invoked and tests or extracts the contents of the appended archive. because the executable stub adds bulk to the archive (the whole purpose of which is to be as small as possible), a number of

urxvt-ml-remote-clipboard	somewhat of a misnomer, this extension adds two menu entries to the selection popup that allows one to run external commands to store the selection somewhere and fetch it again. we use it to implement a "distributed selection mechanism", which just means that one command uploads the file to a remote server, and another reads it. the commands can be set using the "urxvt.remote-selection.store" and "urxvt.remote-selection.fetch" resources. the first should read the selection to store from stdin (always in utf-8
urxvt-ml-searchable-scrollback	adds regex search functionality to the scrollback buffer, triggered by a hotkey (default: "m-s"). while in search mode, normal terminal input/output is suspended and a regex is displayed at the bottom of the screen. inputting characters appends them to the regex and continues incremental search.

"escape" leaves search mode and returns to the point where search was started, while
urxvt-ml-selection	this extension tries to be more intelligent when the user extends selections (double-click and further clicks). right now, it tries to select words, urls and complete shell-quoted arguments, which is very convenient, too, if your ls supports "--quoting-style=shell". a double-click usually selects the word under the cursor, further clicks will enlarge the selection. the selection works by trying to match a number of regexes and displaying them in increasing order of length. you can add your own regexes by specifying
urxvt-ml-selection-autotransform	this selection allows you to do automatic transforms on a selection whenever a selection is made. it works by specifying perl snippets (most useful is a single "s///" operator) that modify $_ as resources: urxvt.selection-autotransform.0: transform urxvt.selection-autotransform.1: transform ...for example, the following will transform selections of the form "filename:number", often seen in compiler messages, into "vi +$filename $word": urxvt.selection-autotransform.0: s/^([^:[:space:]]+):(\\d+):?$/vi +$2 \\q$1\\e\\x0d/and this example matches the same,but replaces it with vi-commands you can paste directly into your (vi :) editor:
urxvt-ml-selection-pastebin	this is a little rarely useful extension that uploads the selection as textfile to a remote site (or does other things).

urxvt256c-matcher	uses per-line display filtering ("on_line_update") to underline text matching a certain pattern and make it clickable. when clicked with the mouse button specified in the "matcher.button" resource (default 2, or middle), the program specified in the "matcher.launcher" resource (default, the "urllauncher" resource, "sensible-browser") will be started with the matched text as first argument. the default configuration is suitable for matching urls and launching a web browser, like the former "mark-urls" extension. the default pattern to match urls can be overridden
urxvt256c-ml	rxvt-unicode, version 9.16, is a colour vt102 terminal emulator intended as an xterm(1) replacement for users who do not require features such as tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. as a result, rxvt-unicode uses much less swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine serving many x sessions. this document is also available on the world-wide-web at http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/doc/rxvt.1.pod <http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/doc/rxvt.1.pod>.<http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/doc/rxvt.1.pod>. 
urxvt256c-ml-background	this extension manages the terminal background by creating a picture that is behind the text, replacing the normal background colour. it does so by evaluating a perl expression that calculates the image on the fly, for example, by grabbing the root background or loading a file. while the full power of perl is available, the operators have been design to be as simple as possible. for example, to load an image and scale it to the window size, you would

urxvt256c-ml-remote-clipboard	somewhat of a misnomer, this extension adds two menu entries to the selection popup that allows one to run external commands to store the selection somewhere and fetch it again. we use it to implement a "distributed selection mechanism", which just means that one command uploads the file to a remote server, and another reads it. the commands can be set using the "urxvt.remote-selection.store" and "urxvt.remote-selection.fetch" resources. the first should read the selection to store from stdin (always in utf-8
urxvt256c-ml-searchable-scrollback	adds regex search functionality to the scrollback buffer, triggered by a hotkey (default: "m-s"). while in search mode, normal terminal input/output is suspended and a regex is displayed at the bottom of the screen. inputting characters appends them to the regex and continues incremental search. "backspace" removes a character from the regex, "up" and "down" search upwards/downwards in the scrollback buffer, "end" jumps to the bottom.

"virt-cat" can be used to quickly view a file. to edit a file, use "virt-edit". for more complex cases you should look at the guestfish(1) tool (see " using guestfish
virt-clone	virt-clone is a command line tool for cloning existing virtual machine images using the "libvirt" hypervisor management library. it will copy the disk images of any existing virtual machine, and define a new guest with an identical virtual hardware configuration. elements which require uniqueness will be updated to avoid a clash between old and new guests. by default, virt-clone will show an error if the necessary information to clone the guest is not provided. the --auto-clone option will generate all
virt-convert	virt-convert is a command line tool for converting virtual machines from one format to another. pass in either a vm definition file (such as vmware vmx format) or a directory containing a vm . by default, a new vm definition file, and converted disk images, will be placed in a new output directory. if an output directory is specified, it will be created if necessary, and the output vm definition placed within, along with any disk images as needed. if
virt-copy-in	"virt-copy-in" copies files and directories from the local disk into a virtual machine disk image or named libvirt domain. you can give one of more filenames and directories on the command line. directories are copied in recursively. the final parameter must be the destination directory in the disk image which must be an absolute path starting with a "/" character.directory in the disk image which must be an absolute path starting with a "/" character.

virt-df	"virt-df" is a command line tool to display free space on virtual machine filesystems. unlike other tools, it doesn't just display the size of disk allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside disk images to see how much space is really being used. if used without any -a or -d arguments, "virt-df" checks with libvirt to get a list of all active and inactive guests, and performs a "df"-type operation on each one in turn, printing out the
virt-edit	"virt-edit" is a command line tool to edit "file" where each "file" exists in the named virtual machine (or disk image). multiple filenames can be given, in which case they are each edited in turn. each filename must be a full path, starting at the root directory (starting with '/'). if you want to just view a file, use virt-cat(1). for more complex cases you should look at the guestfish(1) tool (see " using guestfish " below). "virt-edit" cannot be
virt-filesystems	this tool allows you to discover filesystems, partitions, logical volumes, and their sizes in a disk image or virtual machine. it is a replacement for virt-list-filesystems(1) and virt-list-partitions(1). one use for this tool is from shell scripts to iterate over all filesystems from a disk image: for fs in $(virt-filesystems -a disk.img); do # ... doneanother use is to list partitions before using another tool to modify those partitions (such as virt-resize(1)). if you are curious about what an unknown
virt-format	virt-format takes an existing disk file (or it can be a host partition, lv etc), erases all data on it, and formats it as a blank disk. it can optionally create partition tables, empty filesystems, logical volumes and more. to create a disk containing data, you may be better to use virt-make-fs(1). if you are creating a blank disk to use in guestfish(1), you should instead use the guestfish -n option. normal usage would be something like this: virt-format -a
virt-host-validate	this tool validates that the host is configured in a suitable way to run libvirt hypervisor drivers. if invoked without any arguments it will check support for all hypervisor drivers it is aware of. optionally it can be given a particular hypervisor type ('qemu' or 'lxc') to restrict the checks to those relevant for that virtualization technologyfor that virtualization technology 
virt-image	virt-image is a command line tool for creating virtual machines from an xml image descriptor "image.xml" (virt-image(5)). most attributes of the virtual machine are taken from the xml descriptor (e.g., where the files to back the virtual machine's disks are and how to map them into the guest), though certain information must be added on the command line, such as the name of the guest. the xml descriptor defines most attributes of the guest, making it possible to bundle and
virt-inspector	virt-inspector examines a virtual machine and tries to determine the version of the os , the kernel version, what drivers are installed, whether the virtual machine is fully virtualized ( fv ) or para-virtualized ( pv ), what applications are installed and more. virt-inspector can produce output in several formats, including a readable text report, and xml for feeding into other programs. in the normal usage, use "virt-inspector domname" where "domname" is the libvirt domain (see: "virsh list --all"). you
virt-inspector2	virt-inspector2 examines a virtual machine or disk image and tries to determine the version of the operating system and other information about the virtual machine. virt-inspector2 produces xml output for feeding into other programs. in the normal usage, use "virt-inspector2 -d domname" where "domname" is the libvirt domain (see: "virsh list --all"). you can also run virt-inspector2 directly on disk images from a single virtual machine. use "virt-inspector2 -a disk.img". in rare cases a domain has several block devices, in

x0vncserver	x0vncserver is a tigervnc server which makes any x display remotely accessible via vnc, tigervnc or compatible viewers. unlike xvnc(1), it does not create a virtual display. instead, it just shares an existing x server (typically, that one connected to the physical screen).that one connected to the physical screen). 
x11perf	the x11perf program runs one or more performance tests and reports how fast an x server can execute the tests. many graphics benchmarks assume that the graphics device is used to display the output of a single fancy graphics application, and that the user gets his work done on some other device, like a terminal. such benchmarks usually measure drawing speed for lines, polygons, text, etc. since workstations are not used as standalone graphics engines, but as super-terminals, x11perf measures
x11perfcomp	the x11perfcomp program merges the output of several x11perf(1) runs into a nice tabular format. it takes the results in each file, fills in any missing test results if necessary, and for each test shows the objects/second rate of each server. if invoked with the -r or -ro options, it shows the relative performance of each server to the first server. normally, x11perfcomp uses the first file specified to determine which specific tests it should report on. some (non-dec :)
x11vnc	typical usage is:typical usage is: 
x2sys_binlist	x2sys_binlist reads one or more track data files and produces a multi-segment ascii track bin-index file (tbf) with the track name in the header and one data record per bin crossed; these records contain lon, lat, index, flags[, dist], where lon, lat are the coordinates of the center of the bin, the index is the 1-d number of the bin, and flags is a bitflag that describes which data fields were available in this bin. the optional dist requires -d.
x2sys_cross	x2sys_cross is used to determine all intersections between ("external cross-overs") or within ("internal cross-overs") tracks (cartesian or geographic), and report the time, position, distance along track, heading and speed along each track segment, and the crossover error (coe) and mean values for all observables. the names of the tracks are passed on the command line. by default, x2sys_cross will look for both external and internal coes. as an option, you may choose to project all data using one of the
x2sys_datalist	x2sys_datalist reads one or more files and produces a single ascii [or binary] table. the files can be of any format, which must be described and passed with the -t option. you may limit the output to a geographic region, and insist that the output from several files be separated by a multiple segment header. only the named data fields will be output [default selects all columns].from several files be separated by a multiple segment header. only the named data
x2sys_get	x2sys_get will return the names of the track data files in the x2sys data base for this tag that match the given requirements. you may choose a specific region and optionally ask only for tracks that meet certain data criteria. finally, you may select an option to list all possible pairs that might generate crossovers.option to list all possible pairs that might generate crossovers. 
x2sys_init	x2sys_init is the starting point for anyone wishing to use x2sys; it initializes a set of data bases that are particular to one kind of track data. these data, their associated data bases, and key parameters are given a short-hand notation called an x2sys tag. the tag keeps track of settings such as file format, whether the data are geographic or not, and the binning resolution for track indices. running x2sys_init is a prerequisite to running any of the other
x2sys_list	x2sys_list will read the crossover ascii data base coedbase.txt (or stdin) and extract a subset of the crossovers based on the other arguments. the output may be ascii or binary.and extract a subset of the crossovers based on the other arguments. the output may be ascii or binary. 
x2sys_merge	x2sys_merge will read two crossovers data base and output the contents of the main one updated with the coes in the second one. the second file should only contain updated coes relatively to the first one. that is, it must not contain any new two tracks intersections (this point is not checked in the code). this program is useful when, for any good reason like file editing nav correction or whatever, one had to recompute only the coes between the
x2sys_put	x2sys_put accepts a track bin-index file created by x2sys_binlist and adds this information about the data tracks to the relevant data base. you may chose to overwrite existing data with new information for older tracks (-f) and even completely remove information for certain tracks (-d). the x2sys tag must match the tag encoded in the info.tbf file. to inquire about tracks in the data base, use x2sys_get.data base, use x2sys_get. 
x2sys_report	x2sys_report will read the input crossover ascii data base coedbase.txt (or stdin) and report on the statistics of crossovers (n, mean, stdev, rms, weight) for each track. options are available to let you exclude tracks and limit the output.output. 
x2sys_solve	x2sys_solve will use the supplied crossover information to solve for systematic corrections that can then be applied per track to improve data quality. several systematic corrections can be solved for using a least-squares approach. note: only one data column can be processed at the time.column can be processed at the time. 
x2vnc	x2vnc will let you use two screens on two different computers as if they were connected to the same computer. the computer with the 'main' keyboard must be running x-window, and the second computer should have a vnc server running which will update the contents on the actual screen. this means xvnc is not suitable, but winvnc is. for up-to-date information on x2vnc, see the x2vnc home page: http://fredrik.hubbe.net/x2vnc.htmlfor up-to-date information on x2vnc, see the x2vnc home page: http://fredrik.hubbe.net/x2vnc.html 
x2x	x2x allows the keyboard and mouse on one ("from") x display to be used to control another ("to") x display. since x2x uses the xtest extension, the "to" x display must support xtest. in the default interface, x2x puts a window on the "from" display. this window is labeled with the name of the "to" display. keystrokes typed into this window go to the window on the "to" display that has the input focus. clicking on the x2x window causes

x3270	x3270 opens a telnet connection to an ibm host in an x window. it implements rfcs 2355 (tn3270e), 1576 (tn3270) and 1646 (lu name selection), and supports ind$file file transfer. the window created by x3270 can use its own font for displaying characters, so it is a fairly accurate representation of an ibm 3278 or 3279. it is similar to tn3270(1) except that it is x-based, not curses-based. the full syntax for host is:the full syntax for host is: 
x3270-script	the x3270 scripting facilities allow the interactive 3270 emulators x3270 and c3270 to be operated under the control of another program, and form the basis for the script-only emulator s3270. there are two basic scripting methods. the first is the peer script facility, invoked by the x3270 -script switch, and the default mode for s3270. this runs x3270 or s3270 as a child of another process. typically this would be a script using expect(1), perl(1), or the co-process facility of
x3270if	x3270if provides an interface between scripts and the 3270 emulators x3270, c3270, and s3270. x3270if operates in one of two modes. in action mode, it passes a single action and parameters to the emulator for execution. the result of the action is written to standard output, along with the (optional) status of the emulator. (the action is optional as well, so that x3270if can just reports the emulator status.) in iterative mode, it forms a continuous conduit between a script
x509	the x509 command is a multi purpose certificate utility. it can be used to display certificate information, convert certificates to various forms, sign certificate requests like a "mini ca " or edit certificate trust settings. since there are a large number of options they will split up into various sections.since there are a large number of options they will split up into various sections. 
x86_64-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
x86_64-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
x86_64-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
x86_64-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
x86_64-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
x86_64-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in
x86_64-linux-gnu-elfedit	elfedit updates the elf header of elf files which have the matching elf machine and file types. the options control how and which fields in the elf header should be updated. elffile... are the elf files to be updated. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files.elf files. 
x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
x86_64-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
x86_64-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
x86_64-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
x86_64-linux-gnu-ld.bfd	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and
x86_64-linux-gnu-nlmconv	nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the netware loadable module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for nlm header information. for instructions on writing the nlm command file language used in header files, see the linkers section, nlmlink in particular, of the nlm development and tools overview, which is part of the nlm software developer's kit (" nlm sdk "), available from novell, inc. nlmconv uses the gnu binary file descriptor library to read infile; nlmconv can perform a
x86_64-linux-gnu-nm	gnu nm lists the symbols from object files objfile.... if no object files are listed as arguments, nm assumes the file a.out. for each symbol, nm shows:for each symbol, nm shows: 
x86_64-linux-gnu-objcopy	the gnu objcopy utility copies the contents of an object file to another. objcopy uses the gnu bfd library to read and write the object files. it can write the destination object file in a format different from that of the source object file. the exact behavior of objcopy is controlled by command-line options. note that objcopy should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats. however, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats
x86_64-linux-gnu-objdump	objdump displays information about one or more object files. the options control what particular information to display. this information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work. objfile... are the object files to be examined. when you specify archives, objdump shows information on each of the member object files.files. 
x86_64-linux-gnu-ranlib	ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive. the index lists each symbol defined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file. you may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index. an archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the archive. the gnu ranlib program
x86_64-linux-gnu-readelf	readelf displays information about one or more elf format object files. the options control what particular information to display. elffile... are the object files to be examined. 32-bit and 64-bit elf files are supported, as are archives containing elf files. this program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the bfd library, so if there is a bug in bfd then readelf will not be affected.there is a bug in
x86_64-linux-gnu-size	the gnu size utility lists the section sizes---and the total size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its argument list. by default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each module in an archive. objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used.objfile... are the object files to be examined. if none are specified, the file "a.out" will be used. 
x86_64-linux-gnu-strings	for each file given, gnu strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character. by default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from the whole file. strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.strings is mainly useful for determining the contents
x86_64-linux-gnu-strip	gnu strip discards all symbols from object files objfile. the list of object files may include archives. at least one object file must be given. strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names.strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather than writing modified copies under different names. 
x86_64-linux-gnu-windmc	windmc reads message definitions from an input file (.mc) and translate them into a set of output files. the output files may be of four kinds:kinds: 
x86_64-linux-gnu-windres	windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into an output file. either file may be in one of three formats:windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into an output file. either file may be in one of three formats: 
x86info	this manual page documents x86info, a program which displays a range of information about the cpus present in an x86 system. in order to make full use of this program you need to have the cpu id and msr device drivers in your kernel with accessible device files /dev/cpu/<n>/cpuid and /dev/cpu/<n>/msr./dev/cpu/<n>/cpuid and /dev/cpu/<n>/msr. 
x_edit	the purpose of x_edit is to convert between ascii and binary versions of the crossover correction tables.tables. 
x_init	the purpose of x_init is to create two key files that will be holding all the cross-over information for all the cruises tested. these files are called xx_base.b and xx_legs.b, and they will contain data for each cross-over and totals for each leg, respectively. x_init will create these two files in the current directory, and write out the fileheader with a 1 as the next record number in the case of xx_base.b. nb! any previous files with the same names
x_list	x_list will allow the user to extract information from the xx_base.b and xx_legs.b files. several options can be passed on the command line in order to specify which parameters to extract. they are:options can be passed on the command line in order to specify which parameters to extract. they are: 
x_over	x_over is used to inspect two cruises to see if they intersect, and if so report the time, position, discrepancies in gravity/magnetics/bathymetry, heading for each track segment, and the average values of the geophysical observables at the cross-over point. the names of the legs are passed on the command line. if they are identical or only one name is passed, then x_over looks for internal cross-overs. the optional parameters are:cross-overs. the optional parameters are: 
x_remove	x_remove will read a list of 'bad' cruises, read the xsystem data base files, and write out new xsystem files that do not include any coes generated by the bad cruises. this is useful if certain cruises turn out to have systematic errors (e.g., the topography values were inadvertently given as fathoms instead of meters), and we would like to re-run x_over/x_update after the systematic errors have been rectified. the new file names will consist of the old file names
x_report	x_report reads the x_system data base file and prints out statistics for each leg. the statistics are the number of, means, and standard deviations of coes for both the internal and external cases. one or more data types (gmt) may be specified.are the number of, means, and standard deviations of coes for both the internal and external cases. one or more data types (gmt) may be specified.

xtensa-linux-gnu-addr2line	addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers. given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it. the executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option. the default is the file a.out. the section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option. addr2line has two modes
xtensa-linux-gnu-ar	the gnu ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. an archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive). the original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. gnu ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured
xtensa-linux-gnu-as	gnu as is really a family of assemblers. if you use (or have used) the gnu assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture. each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax. as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the gnu c compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld". nevertheless, we've tried to
xtensa-linux-gnu-c++filt	the c ++ and java languages provide function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that each function takes parameters of different types. in order to be able to distinguish these similarly named functions c ++ and java encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each different version. this process is known as mangling. the c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into user-level names
xtensa-linux-gnu-cpp	the c preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the c compiler to transform your program before compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. the c preprocessor is intended to be used only with c, c ++ , and objective-c source code. in the past, it has been abused as a general text processor. it will choke on input
xtensa-linux-gnu-dlltool	dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the command line. it then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports file. if the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in

xtensa-linux-gnu-gcc	when you invoke gcc , it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. the "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. for example, the -c option says not to run the linker. then the output consists of object files output by the assembler. other options are passed on to one stage of processing. some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
xtensa-linux-gnu-gcov	gcov is a test coverage program. use it in concert with gcc to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program. you can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code. you can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool, gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time. profiling tools
xtensa-linux-gnu-gprof	"gprof" produces an execution profile of c, pascal, or fortran77 programs. the effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile of each caller. the profile data is taken from the call graph profile file (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiled with the -pg option of "cc", "pc", and "f77". the -pg option also links in versions of the library routines that are compiled for profiling. "gprof" reads the given object file (the default is "a.out")
xtensa-linux-gnu-ld	ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. usually the last step in compiling a program is to run ld. ld accepts linker command language files written in a superset of at&t 's link editor command language syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process. this man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language and

zrancid	rancid is a perl(1) script which uses the login scripts (see clogin(1)) to login to a device, execute commands to display the configuration, etc, then filters the output for formatting, security, and so on. rancid's product is a file with the name of it's last argument plus the suffix .new. for example, hostname.new. there are complementary scripts for other platforms and/or manufacturers that are supported by rancid(1). briefly, these are:there are complementary scripts for other platforms and/or manufacturers that are
zrun	prefixing a shell command with "zrun" causes any compressed files that are arguments of the command to be transparently uncompressed to temp files (not pipes) and the uncompressed files fed to the command. this is a quick way to run a command that does not itself support compressed files, without manually uncompressing the files. the following compression types are supported: gz bz2 z xz lzma lzo if zrun is linked to some name beginning with z, like zprog, and the
zsh	zsh is a unix command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command processor. of the standard shells, zsh most closely resembles ksh but includes many enhancements. zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a host of other features.functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a host of other features.

zshcalsys	the shell is supplied with a series of functions to replace and enhance the traditional unix calendar programme, which warns the user of imminent or future events, details of which are stored in a text file (typically calendar in the user's home directory). the version provided here includes a mechanism for alerting the user when an event is due. in addition a function age is provided that can be used in a glob qualifier; it allows files to be selected
zshcompctl	this version of zsh has two ways of performing completion of words on the command line. new users of the shell may prefer to use the newer and more powerful system based on shell functions; this is described in zshcompsys(1), and the basic shell mechanisms which support it are described in zshcompwid(1). this manual entry describes the older compctl command.zshcompwid(1). this manual entry describes the older compctl command. 
zshcompsys	this describes the shell code for the 'new' completion system, referred to as compsys. it is written in shell functions based on the features described in zshcompwid(1). the features are contextual, sensitive to the point at which completion is started. many completions are already provided. for this reason, a user can perform a great many tasks without knowing any details beyond how to initialize the system, which is described below in initialization. the context that decides what completion is to
zshcompwid	the shell's programmable completion mechanism can be manipulated in two ways; here the low-level features supporting the newer, function-based mechanism are defined. a complete set of shell functions based on these features is described in zshcompsys(1), and users with no interest in adding to that system (or, potentially, writing their own -- see dictionary entry for 'hubris') should skip the current section. the older system based on the compctl builtin command is described in zshcompctl(1). completion widgets are defined by
zshcontrib	the zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by the user community. these are not inherently a part of the shell, and some may not be available in every zsh installation. the most significant of these are documented here. for documentation on other contributed items such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files.look for comments in the function source files. 
zshexpn	the following types of expansions are performed in the indicated order in five steps:the following types of expansions are performed in the indicated order in five steps: 
zshmodules	some optional parts of zsh are in modules, separate from the core of the shell. each of these modules may be linked in to the shell at build time, or can be dynamically linked while the shell is running if the installation supports this feature. the modules that are bundled with the zsh distribution are:dynamically linked while the shell is running if the installation supports this feature. the modules that are bundled with the zsh distribution are: 
zshparam	a parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes. a name may be any sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, or the single characters '*', '@', '#', '?', '-', '$', or '!'. the value may be a scalar (a string), an integer, an array (indexed numerically), or an associative array (an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by name). to declare the type of a parameter, or to assign a scalar or integer value to a parameter,
zshtcpsys	a module zsh/net/tcp is provided to provide network i/o over tcp/ip from within the shell; see its description in zshmodules(1) . this manual page describes a function suite based on the module. if the module is installed, the functions are usually installed at the same time, in which case they will be available for autoloading in the default function search path. in addition to the zsh/net/tcp module, the zsh/zselect module is used to implement timeouts on read operations. for troubleshooting
zshzftpsys	this describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source distribution as an interface to the zftp builtin command, allowing you to perform ftp operations from the shell command line or within functions or scripts. the interface is similar to a traditional ftp client (e.g. the ftp command itself, see ftp(1)), but as it is entirely done within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing features, and so on, are present, and macros are particularly simple to
zshzle	if the zle option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells) and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user is able to edit command lines. there are two display modes. the first, multiline mode, is the default. it only works if the term parameter is set to a valid terminal type that can move the cursor up. the second, single line mode, is used if term is invalid or incapable of moving the cursor
zsoelim	soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form . by the contents of file. it is useful if files included with so need to be preprocessed. normally, soelim should be invoked with the -s option of groff. note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot and the two characters 's' and 'o'. otherwise, only groff interprets the .so request (and soelim ignores it).request (and soelim ignores it). 
zssh	zssh (zmodem ssh) is a program for interactively transferring files to a remote machine while using the secure shell ( ssh ). it is intended to be a convenient alternative to scp , allowing to transfer files without having to open another session and re-authenticate oneself. zssh is an interactive wrapper for ssh used to switch the ssh connection between the remote shell and file transfers. this is achieved by using another tty/pty pair between the user and the local
zsync	downloads a file over http. zsync uses a control file to determine whether any blocks in the file are already known to the downloader, and only downloads the new blocks. either a filename or a url can be given on the command line - this is the path of the control file for the download, which normally has the name of the actual file to downlaod with .zsync appended. (to create this .zsync file you have to have a copy
zsyncmake	constructs a metafile for the zsync client program to use to perform partial file downloads. filename is the file that users wish to downloads; zsyncmake constructs the appropriate metafile and writes filename.zsync in the current directory. zsync will need at least one url from which to download the file content. if the .zsync will be in the same directory as the file to download, you can accept the default - zsync includes a relative url in the control file. if

zvbi-atsc-cc	zvbi-atsc-cc captures atsc tv transmissions using a linux dvb device and decodes the enclosed closed caption data. it can record both ntsc caption (eia 608-b) and dtvcc caption (cea 708-c).(eia 608-b) and dtvcc caption (cea 708-c). 
zvbi-chains	zvbi-chains is a small wrapper which executes the vbi application given on the command line while overloading several c library calls (such as open(2) and read(2)) so that the application can be forced to access vbi devices via the vbi proxy instead of device files directly. ld_preload is used to intercept c library calls and call functions in the libzvbi-chain shared library instead. parameters given on the command line (e.g. device path) are passed to the library by means of
